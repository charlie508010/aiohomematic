# Version 2026.9.5 (2026-09-16)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Classic BidCos-RF channel-0 diagnostics initialize reliably.** If ReGa omits
  `RSSI_DEVICE`, `RSSI_PEER`, `LOW_BAT` or `LOWBAT` from its bulk snapshot, the
  value is now read from the CCU with `getValue`. Invalid converted RSSI values,
  including the `-65535` sentinel, are no longer reported as valid.

- **Stopping an interface client also stops its command throttle.** Integration
  reloads no longer leave a `CommandThrottle-*` worker pending in the event loop.

- **A device no longer loses every channel after a firmware update or a re-pairing.**
  `updateDevice` (hint 0), `readdedDevice` and `replaceDevice` drop the device and all
  of its channels from the device description and paramset description caches and then
  re-fetch it by address. That re-fetch called `getDeviceDescription`, which returns the
  device level only — the channel descriptions were never fetched again.

  A device without cached channel descriptions is built without a single channel:
  `Device.__init__()` logs `INIT_DEVICE: Skipping channel … - description could not be
retrieved from CCU` for each of them and keeps only the device-level data points. In
  Home Assistant the device is left with its `update` entity and nothing else — window
  contacts, switches and heating groups lose every state.

  The loss is persisted and does not heal: `listDevices` reports the device as known, so
  the backend sends no `newDevices` callback for the missing channels, and the gap
  survives every restart and every downgrade. A CCU update that makes the backend
  announce changed device descriptions could therefore strip a large part of an
  installation at once (#3407, #3403).

  All three paths now fetch the device together with its channel descriptions
  (`get_all_device_descriptions()`), which also restores the paramset descriptions for
  those channels.

- **An already damaged cache repairs itself.** Before devices are created from the cache,
  every device whose `CHILDREN` are not fully cached is re-fetched from the backend. The
  repair is logged as `REPAIR_DEVICE_DESCRIPTIONS` and persisted, so an installation that
  lost its channel descriptions recovers on the next start without deleting any cache file.

- **`_identify_missing_device_descriptions()` really checks channel addresses.** It
  compared against `get_addresses()`, which returns device addresses only, so every
  channel description was reported as missing regardless of the cache content. It now uses
  `DeviceDescriptionRegistry.has_address()`.

# Version 2026.9.4 (2026-09-12)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **BidCos-RF data points no longer stay on `restored` after a start.** The ReGa bulk
  fetch collects every value the backend knows and stores it in the central data cache.
  That snapshot is taken once during `start_clients()` and expires after
  `MAX_CACHE_AGE`. For a channel other than 0 its only consumer is the
  integration adding its entities, which happens after the platforms have been forwarded
  — in a real installation reliably later than that. By then the snapshot was gone.

  For the interfaces in `INTERFACES_SKIPPING_INIT_GETVALUE_FALLBACK` (BidCos-RF,
  VirtualDevices, CUxD, CCU-Jack) there is no per-parameter `getValue` fallback (#3228,
  #3260, #3274), so the bulk snapshot is the only source of an initial value. An expired
  snapshot therefore left the data point unset — permanently, for anything that does not
  emit an event on its own. Covers were the visible case: a shutter reports nothing until
  it is moved, so `HM-LC-Bl1PBU-FM` blinds stayed on `value_state=restored` with
  `current_position: 0` until they were operated by hand. Sensors and thermostats hid the
  same defect behind their regular events.

  The init path now refreshes the snapshot when it has expired instead of giving up, and
  reads the value from the refreshed data. The `getValue` fallback stays disabled;
  nothing about the #3260 decision changes.

  Two things bound the cost of that refresh. Concurrent readers share one refresh through
  a per-interface lock. And a refresh that comes back empty is remembered, so the next
  reader does not immediately try again: `fetch_all_device_data()` stores only a non-empty
  result, so an empty backend answer leaves `_refreshed_at` untouched and the existing
  `MAX_CACHE_AGE / 3` guard in `load()` never engages. The lock alone does not cover this
  — it coalesces concurrent callers, while the callers on this path are serialized by the
  value cache semaphore, so each of them would have triggered its own ReGa script run.
  An empty bulk result is not hypothetical: the script emits only data points that carry a
  valid `Timestamp()`, and on the interfaces above that can be very few or none. Adding
  hundreds of entities now costs roughly one script call per cache period of startup —
  which does not touch the duty cycle.

- **Battery and diagnostic data points no longer stay on `restored` after a start.**
  Parameters on the init ignore list (`LOW_BAT`, `LOWBAT`, `OPERATING_VOLTAGE`,
  `DUTY_CYCLE`, `DUTYCYCLE`, plus the `ERROR_*`, `RSSI_*` and `*_ERROR` patterns, and
  every data point of `HmIP-SWSD*` / `HmIP-SWD`) deliberately skip the per-parameter
  `getValue` during init, so they do not wake a battery-powered device. That makes the
  bulk snapshot their only source of an initial value — and unlike the regular init path,
  this one read the snapshot without refreshing it first. Once it had expired, the data
  point stayed unset: `is_valid` stays `False`, which the integration reports as
  `value_state: restored`.

  Unlike a cover's `LEVEL`, these parameters do not recover on their own. `LOW_BAT` is
  sent only when it changes, so a device that reported a low battery before the start kept
  showing a normal battery until the battery was replaced — while a direct
  `get_device_value` on the same parameter returned the correct value all along.

  This affects every interface, not only those without a `getValue` fallback. The ignored
  parameters now refresh an expired snapshot the same way the regular init path does. No
  `getValue` is added for them.

- **A fresh snapshot for one interface no longer skips the others.**
  `CentralDataCache.load()` left the loop over all clients with `return` instead of
  `continue` when it found a recently refreshed interface, so every client after it was
  never loaded.

- **`changed_within_seconds()` no longer ignores whole days.** It read
  `timedelta.seconds`, which drops the day part, so a change from exactly 24 h ago
  counted as recent. It now uses `total_seconds()`.

### Changed

- **`MAX_CACHE_AGE` raised from 10 s to 15 s.** It governs the lifetime of the central
  data cache, the device details cache refresh guard (`MAX_CACHE_AGE / 3`) and the
  default staleness window of `changed_within_seconds()` — so a data point is now
  reloaded at most every 15 s instead of every 10 s.

# Version 2026.9.3 (2026-09-11)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Devices no longer stay unavailable after a reconnect.** The backend announces
  `UNREACH` only when the value changes. If a device becomes reachable again while the
  connection is down — a backend restart resets the flag, or the device recovers while
  the proxy is gone — that transition is never delivered, and aiohomematic keeps the
  stale `UNREACH=true` for as long as the central runs.

  Nothing closed that gap, because `UN_REACH` and `STICKY_UN_REACH` are hidden
  parameters and therefore carry `DataPointUsage.NO_CREATE`. `refresh_data_point_data()`
  iterates `get_readable_generic_data_points()`, which excludes exactly those, so the
  recovery data load never touched them. The only path that reads them via RPC is
  `_ValueCache.init_base_data_points()`, and that runs solely for newly created devices.
  The result: the client reconnects, events flow, commands work — and every device that
  was marked unreachable before the outage stays unavailable in Home Assistant until the
  integration is reloaded or `force_device_availability` is applied by hand.

  `Device.reload_availability_state()` re-reads the channel 0 `VALUES` paramset and
  applies `UN_REACH`, `STICKY_UN_REACH` and `CONFIG_PENDING` through the regular event
  path, so the recovered availability reaches the data points of every channel. The
  connection recovery now performs that re-read for all devices of the interface before
  refreshing the remaining data — in the staged data load as well as in the circuit
  breaker recovery — which also unblocks that refresh, since the value cache refuses to
  read parameters of a device it considers unavailable.

  The re-read deliberately uses `getParamset` instead of the per-parameter `getValue`
  fallback: the latter is skipped for the interfaces in
  `INTERFACES_SKIPPING_INIT_GETVALUE_FALLBACK` (BidCos-RF, VirtualDevices, CUxD,
  CCU-Jack), so building on it would have produced a fix that silently does nothing on
  four of six interfaces.

  The value is measured, never defaulted: a read that fails, or a paramset that does not
  carry the parameter, leaves the data point untouched. That distinction matters — a
  boolean data point without a value falls back to its paramset default (`false`), so a
  swallowed read error would have silently reported every unreachable device as
  reachable. Contract tests pin both directions.

# Version 2026.9.2 (2026-09-06)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **A cover command is no longer dropped while the cover is moving.**
  `CustomDpCover.is_state_change()` compared the requested position against the last
  level confirmed by the backend. Classic shutter actuators (`HM-LC-Bl1-*` and
  relatives) re-report the _old_ level when they start working and only report the new
  one once the movement has finished. That echo clears the optimistic value, so during
  the whole travel the cover reads as if it were still at its starting position.

  A command that reverses the movement back to where the cover came from therefore
  compared equal to the current position and was discarded before it reached the
  backend: `cover.set_cover_position` with the origin position, and `cover.close_cover`
  while opening (and the mirrored pair while closing). Nothing was sent, nothing was
  logged above DEBUG, and the service call reported success. Commands with any other
  target were unaffected, and whether the drop happened at all depended on a race
  between the echo and the second command — which made it look intermittent.

  `is_state_change()` now treats a running movement as a state change. `DIRECTION` is
  the only signal left at that point, since the echo has already cleared the optimistic
  value. While the cover stands still, an identical command is still suppressed as
  before. Regression tests cover both.

- **The `NO_STATE_CHANGE` debug line names the data point it belongs to.** It logged
  `name`, which is empty for a primary custom data point whose channel name equals the
  device name — so the line that tells you a command was suppressed did not say which
  data point suppressed it. It now logs `full_name`.

# Version 2026.9.1 (2026-09-03)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **A guard keeps the prek hook revisions and the pinned tool versions from
  drifting apart.** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins five tools in `rev:`, and
  `requirements_test_pre_commit.txt` pins the very same five for the test
  environment. Nothing linked the two files, so they were kept in sync by hand —
  and at the previous commit they were not: `codespell` ran at `v2.4.2` from the
  hook while the requirements installed `2.4.3`, `yamllint` at `v1.37.1` against
  `1.38.0`, `python-typing-update` at `v0.7.3` against `v0.8.1`. A hook that
  lints with a different release than CI installs reports different findings in
  the two places, which is exactly the kind of difference nobody looks for.

  `script/check_pre_commit_pins.py` closes that gap as the `check-pre-commit-pins`
  hook. The link it checks is **declared in the two files, never inferred**: no
  rule maps `charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit` to the package `ruff`, so each pin
  now names the hook repo it mirrors in a trailing `# pre-commit: <repo-url>`
  comment (or `# pre-commit: local` for a tool behind a `repo: local` hook), and
  each remote repo that deliberately carries no pin is marked `# no-pin: <reason>`
  on the line above its `- repo:` entry. Guessing the mapping from names would
  have produced a check that looks right and silently mismatches the day a repo
  and its package stop sharing a name.

  That marker sits on its own line for a reason worth recording: prettier
  rewrites a YAML trailing comment down to a single leading space, and yamllint
  then rejects it for having fewer than two — no trailing form passes both hooks.

  Beyond version drift the guard also catches a hook repo added without a
  matching pin, a pin naming a repo the config no longer has, a pin with no
  mapping comment at all, and a repo that is both mapped and marked `# no-pin:`.
  Twenty tests cover the parsers and each failure class, including a check that
  the repository's own two files agree.

- **The bulk device-data fetch reports how many values it returned.**
  `get_all_device_data` logged only the name of the ReGa script it invoked, never
  anything about the response. That made the single most useful fact about a start
  invisible from the outside: whether the fetch returned values at all. When a data
  point stays unset after a restart, the size of that result is what separates "the
  backend holds no timestamped value for it" from "the value arrived and was not
  applied" — two causes with opposite fixes, previously indistinguishable without a
  session recording. A `DEBUG` line now states the count per interface, and it is
  emitted outside the result branch so an empty result — the interesting case — is
  logged too. The count is deliberately all it carries: it answers the question,
  while the keys themselves would add device addresses to the log for no further
  diagnostic value.

### Fixed

- **`HmIP-HEATING` groups no longer hang at the restored Home Assistant state when
  the operating mode stays untouched (#3376).** `CustomDpIpThermostat` gated its
  validity on `SET_POINT_MODE`, which the CCU reports only when the operating mode
  actually changes — unlike `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` and `SET_POINT_TEMPERATURE`, which
  keep arriving.

  Heating groups on the `VirtualDevices` interface have no second source to fall back
  on. After a CCU restart the mode data point carries a `Timestamp()` but no
  `LastTimestamp()`, so the ReGa bulk fetch skips it (that gate is deliberate, #3228),
  and `VirtualDevices` has no per-parameter `getValue` fallback either — for a virtual
  group `getValue` can only return the CCU-internal placeholder. A group whose mode had
  not changed since the restart therefore stayed at `value_state=restored` with frozen
  `current_temperature`/`target_temperature` for as long as the mode stayed put, while
  the sibling `sensor.*` entities kept updating from the very same events.

  Validity now follows `TEMPERATURE` and `SETPOINT`; until `SET_POINT_MODE` arrives,
  `mode` reports its existing `AUTO` fallback. Same failure class and same remedy as
  the classic RF thermostats in `2026.8.5` and the earlier heating-group fixes (#3255,
  #3279). A regression test covers a group that reports temperature and setpoint but
  never `SET_POINT_MODE`, and the validity contract test is updated.

  This does not cover a group whose `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` is missing from the bulk
  result as well — such a group has no value at all and still waits for the first
  event.

- **A system variable whose declared type does not match its value is kept as text
  instead of being dropped (#3377).** `SysVar.getAll` reports a type per variable,
  and `_build_sysvar_record` trusted it: `LIST` and `INTEGER` went through `int()`,
  and a `NUMBER` without a decimal point was treated as `INTEGER` first.

  The reported variable is a value list holding a single entry — the way to park a
  string on a CCU that would not take it as a plain string variable. For that
  constellation the backend returns the entry itself as the value, not its index,
  so `int()` raised, the record was discarded, and no data point ever appeared.
  The `ERROR` was logged on every scan: 4075 times in the submitted log, at a 60 s
  scan interval, for one variable named `V.Pushover.UserKey`. Disabling it in the
  integration does not help — `enabled_default` is resolved before the value is
  parsed.

  The record now survives: on a conversion failure the variable falls back to
  `STRING`, keeps the raw value, and drops `minValue`/`maxValue`. It also drops
  `extended_sysvar`, so a declared type we could not verify never yields a writable
  data point — a select whose only option is the payload, or a string written back
  to a variable the backend holds as a float, would both be wrong. The log moves to
  `WARNING`, is emitted once per variable id per client, and names the type the
  backend declared.

### Changed

- Routine tooling bumps: `prek` 0.5.2, `pylint` 4.0.8, `uv` 0.12.9, and
  `codespell` 2.4.3, `yamllint` 1.38.0 and `python-typing-update` 0.8.1 in both
  the pinned requirements and the pre-commit revisions.

# Version 2026.8.8 (2026-08-29)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **System variables and programs are keyed on their id, not on their name.**
  Renaming a system variable or a program in the CCU WebUI re-keyed its Home
  Assistant entity, which took its history, its area, its customisations and
  every automation built on it. The person who tidies up their variable names
  was the one who lost.

  `GenericHubDataPoint` built the routing key from `slugify(legacy_name)` for
  every hub data point. That is right for the ones whose name is a module
  constant — alarm and service messages, the inbox, metrics, connectivity,
  install mode — because none of those can be renamed. It was wrong for the
  two families that can be, and both already carried a stable id:
  `SystemVariableData.vid` and `ProgramData.pid`.

  The parameter slot is an overridable hook now, and those two subclasses
  override it. Each falls back to the slug when the id is empty, so a backend
  that has not resolved an id yet still produces a key, and a client rebuilding
  one can accept both shapes during a rollover.

  **Every system variable and program entity re-keys once on this upgrade.**
  That is the price of ending a re-key that happened on every rename, and it
  needs the matching registry migration in `homematicip_local` to ship
  alongside — without it those entities orphan instead of moving.

  The mapping had no test. The routing-key function was covered thoroughly;
  nothing asserted which value a sysvar or a program put into it, which is how
  a key built from a renameable name survived this long. Four cases cover it
  now, including both fallbacks.

### Changed

- Routine dependency and tooling bumps: `pydantic>=2.13.5`, `coverage` 7.16.0,
  `prek` 0.5.0, `pymdown-extensions` 11.0.2, `pytest-rerunfailures` 16.6,
  `pytest-socket` 0.8.1, `uv` 0.12.7, and `ruff` 0.16.5 in both the pinned
  requirements and the pre-commit revision.

# Version 2026.8.7 (2026-08-28)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **`capabilities` is reachable on a category-specific protocol.** Every custom
  category already answers what it can do through a frozen capability dataclass —
  `CoverCapabilities`, `SirenCapabilities`, `LockCapabilities`,
  `ClimateCapabilities`, `LightCapabilities` — but that answer was only available
  on the concrete classes. `aiohomematic/interfaces/` carried `BackendCapabilities`
  on the client protocol and nothing per category.

  A consumer that wants to dispatch on what a device _can do_ rather than on what
  class it _is_ therefore had to keep importing the concrete classes, which ties
  it to one backend's class identity. The new module
  `aiohomematic.interfaces.custom` supplies the missing typing basis: one
  `@runtime_checkable` protocol per category, carrying that category's
  `capabilities` plus the public API every implementation of the category shares.

  Where a capability flag gates an _optional_ method surface, that surface gets
  its own sub-protocol, so the flag and the type stay in step:
  `TiltCoverDataPointProtocol` for `capabilities.tilt`,
  `GarageDataPointProtocol` for `capabilities.vent`, and
  `SoundPlayerDataPointProtocol` for `capabilities.soundfiles`. Climate, light and
  lock need none — every surface their flags gate is already on the category base
  class.

  Each category declares members beyond `capabilities`, so an `isinstance` check
  discriminates between categories instead of merely finding a `capabilities`
  attribute; a new contract test pins that, the explicit inheritance, and the
  agreement between each flag and its sub-protocol.

  The change is purely additive. The concrete classes gain a protocol base and
  keep every member they had.

### Fixed

- **CUxD addresses are scoped by the central in `generate_unique_id`.**
  ⚠️ **Breaking:** this re-keys the CUxD entities of every installation on
  upgrade, including direct-CCU installations. See the migration guide
  `docs/migrations/cuxd_unique_id_scoping_migration_2026_08.md`.

  `generate_unique_id` namespaces a key with the central id for the hub
  pseudo-addresses, for `INT000*` and for the virtual-remote roots — every
  address family that repeats verbatim from CCU to CCU. CUxD is such a family
  and was missing from the list.

  CUxD hands out the same synthetic addresses on every CCU it runs on;
  `CUX2801001` exists on practically every installation that runs it. Two CCUs
  bridged into one Home Assistant therefore declared identical CUxD
  `unique_id`s, and Home Assistant keeps whichever arrived first and drops the
  other CCU's entities — permanently, once the payload is retained. The
  `openccu-loom` backend already scoped CUxD and carried the gap as a declared
  divergence from this library, with a retirement condition pointing here.

  `generate_channel_unique_id` is deliberately unchanged: it namespaces the
  virtual-remote roots only, on both sides. Scoping channel ids as well would
  break parity in the other direction.

  A new contract test pins the full cross-implementation golden set — the
  address fold, the parameter append, the prefix order, the lowercasing, and
  exactly which address families are scoped at parameter and at channel level.

# Version 2026.8.6 (2026-08-28)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **An inbox entry can say that it is awaiting release.** A device can sit in
  the inbox in two different states, and a consumer that cannot tell them apart
  offers the wrong action for one of them.

  The `openccu-loom` backend onboards a device in two steps: it is **accepted**
  first — gaining its ise_id, its channels and its data points, so it can be
  renamed and assigned rooms — and **released** to the ecosystems only
  afterwards. The order is the point: an ecosystem that sees a device first and
  is corrected afterwards keeps the identity it saw, so Home Assistant would
  mint entity ids from the still-unnamed device.

  Between those steps the device appears in the same inbox listing as one that
  is genuinely waiting for a decision, where the only action on offer is
  _accept_ — and for this entry that is exactly wrong: it is accepted already,
  and what it needs is a release.

  `InboxDeviceData.awaiting_release` carries the distinction. It defaults to
  `False` and is optional for every existing caller, because a CCU reached
  directly has no such middle state — it goes straight from waiting to in
  service, so the default is the truth there rather than a placeholder.

# Version 2026.8.5 (2026-08-23)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **`HM-CC-TC` climate no longer freezes at the restored Home Assistant state.**
  `CustomDpSimpleRfThermostat` gated its validity on `TEMPERATURE` **and** `SETPOINT`, but
  `HM-CC-TC` reports `SETPOINT` (channel 2, `CLIMATECONTROL_REGULATOR`) only when the wheel
  is turned on the device — never periodically. The ReGa bulk fetch skips data points
  without a timestamp, and since the BidCos-RF interface no longer falls back to a
  per-parameter `getValue` during init, `SETPOINT` stayed unrefreshed forever on a device
  that had not been touched since the last CCU restart. That dragged the whole custom
  climate data point to `is_valid=False`, so Home Assistant kept the entity in
  `value_state=restored` and froze `current_temperature`/`target_temperature`/`hvac_mode` at
  the last (re)start value — while the sibling `sensor.*` entities (gated on their own data
  point) kept updating from the very same `TEMPERATURE` events. Validity now follows
  `TEMPERATURE` alone; `target_temperature` stays `None` until the first real `SETPOINT`
  arrives instead of reporting a stale restored value. Same pattern as the earlier
  heating-group fixes (#3255, #3279). A regression test covers a thermostat that only ever
  receives `TEMPERATURE` events, and the validity contract test is updated.
- **Classic RF thermostats no longer hang at the restored state when the operating mode
  stays untouched.** Same failure class as above: `CustomDpRfThermostat` (`HM-CC-RT-DN`,
  `HM-TC-IT-WM-W-EU`, `HM-CC-VG-1`, `BC-RT-TRX-*`, `BC-TC-C-WM`) also gated its validity on
  `CONTROL_MODE`. Unlike `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` and `SET_TEMPERATURE`, which these devices
  report every few minutes, `CONTROL_MODE` is only sent when the operating mode actually
  changes — so after a CCU restart it can stay unrefreshed for as long as nobody switches
  between AUTO and MANU, keeping the climate entity at `value_state=restored` with frozen
  live values. Validity now follows `TEMPERATURE` and `SETPOINT`; until `CONTROL_MODE`
  arrives, `mode` reports its existing `AUTO` fallback. A regression test covers a wall
  thermostat that reports temperature, setpoint and humidity but never `CONTROL_MODE`.

# Version 2026.8.4 (2026-08-22)

## What's Changed

### Added

- Expose the garage door's discrete mode (closed/ventilation/open) as a `SELECT`-category combined data point. Home Assistant's `cover` platform has no native ventilation state (see home-assistant/architecture#502), so the ventilation command was previously only reachable via the undiscoverable position-range workaround in the integration. `CustomDpGarage` now declares a `CombinedDpGarageDoorMode` (via `CombinedGarageDoorModeField`) that reads `DOOR_STATE` and writes `DOOR_COMMAND`, exposing the three physical states as a first-class select entity that the integration's generic `SELECT`-category dispatch picks up without any integration-side wiring. The data point carries its own parameter name `DOOR_MODE` (new `CombinedParameter` enum) rather than borrowing the identity of `DOOR_STATE`, so it is named "Door Mode" and uses the translation key `door_mode` — consumers that want a localized name need to add that key. While the door is travelling, the select keeps showing the mode the door is heading for instead of dropping to `unknown`; a `STOP` clears that held mode. The `GarageDoorActivity`/`GarageDoorCommand`/`GarageDoorState` enums moved from `aiohomematic/model/custom/cover.py` to `aiohomematic/const.py` so the combined data point can share them with `CustomDpGarage` without a circular import.

### Fixed

- Correct `GarageDoorState.POSITION_UNKNOWN`, which carried a stray leading underscore (`_POSITION_UNKNOWN`) and therefore never matched the `DOOR_STATE` value reported by the CCU.

# Version 2026.8.3 (2026-08-14)

## What's Changed

### Added

- Add support for the flush-mount switch actuators `HmIP-FS6` and `HmIP-FSI6`.
  `HmIP-FS6` has no input channel, so it shares the channel layout of `HmIP-FSM`
  (channel 1 `SWITCH_TRANSMITTER`, channel 2 `SWITCH_VIRTUAL_RECEIVER`) and is now
  registered as an `IPSwitch` profile on channel 2. Without that registration it only
  produced generic data points. `OPERATING_VOLTAGE` is ignored for `HmIP-FS6` as well,
  consistent with the other mains-powered actuators such as `HmIP-FSM`.

### Fixed

- Expose `CHANNEL_OPERATION_MODE` on channel 1 of `HmIP-FSI6`. The custom switch data
  point of that device already worked, because the model resolves to channel 3 through
  the existing `HmIP-FSI` prefix registration, but the un-ignore rule in
  `RELEVANT_MASTER_PARAMSETS_BY_DEVICE` was keyed on `HmIP-FSI16` only. Model keys are
  matched with `str.startswith`, and `"hmip-fsi6".startswith("hmip-fsi16")` is `False`,
  so the operation mode of the push-button input stayed hidden.

## Tests

- `tests/test_model_switch.py` pins the switch channel of the flush-mount actuators:
  channel 2 for the variants without an input channel (`HmIP-FS6`, `HmIP-FSM`,
  `HmIP-FSM16`) and channel 3 for those with a push-button input (`HmIP-FSI6`,
  `HmIP-FSI16`).
- `tests/test_store_visibility.py` pins that both `HmIP-FSI16` and `HmIP-FSI6` un-ignore
  `CHANNEL_OPERATION_MODE`, so the prefix matching cannot silently drop the shorter
  model name again, and that `OPERATING_VOLTAGE` stays ignored for `HmIP-FS6` and
  `HmIP-FSM`.

# Version 2026.8.2 (2026-08-10)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- Fix calculated data points (`DEW_POINT`, `VAPOR_CONCENTRATION`, `FROST_POINT`,
  `ENTHALPY`, `DEW_POINT_SPREAD`, `APPARENT_TEMPERATURE`, `OPERATING_VOLTAGE_LEVEL`)
  freezing on their restored value after the update to 2026.8.1, while the underlying
  temperature and humidity data points kept updating (#3343). `CalculatedDataPointField`
  resolves its source data point lazily on first access, and the climate sensors never
  triggered that resolution outside of `value`. With the stricter validity gating
  introduced in #3335, an unresolved source set made `is_valid` report `False` — and
  because Home Assistant reads `is_valid` before it reads the value, it kept serving the
  restored state and never performed the first value read that would have resolved the
  sources. On top of that, the per-source update subscription is created during
  resolution, so no source update ever reached the calculated data point either.
  `CalculatedDataPoint` now resolves every declared source field when it is constructed.

## Tests

- New contract test `tests/contract/test_calculated_source_resolution_contract.py` pins
  that every calculated data point resolves and subscribes to its declared sources at
  construction time and can report validity without a prior value read.
- The fake channel/device/data point helpers used to construct model objects without a
  central unit moved from `tests/test_model_calculated.py` to `tests/helpers/fake_model.py`.

# Version 2026.8.1 (2026-08-02)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- Fix calculated data points (`OPERATING_VOLTAGE_LEVEL`, `VAPOR_CONCENTRATION`,
  `DEW_POINT`, …) reporting `is_valid=True` while their value is `None`, which left the
  corresponding Home Assistant entities stuck at `unknown` after a restart instead of
  restoring their previous state (#3332). `CalculatedDataPoint` inherited its validity
  from `BaseDataPoint`, where `is_valid` only aggregates `is_refreshed` and
  `is_status_valid` of the source data points. A source that was read at startup but
  returned no usable value is refreshed, so the calculated data point claimed validity
  with nothing to calculate from — and because Home Assistant only restores a previous
  state for data points that report themselves as invalid, the restore path never ran.
  Validity now requires every state-carrying source to be valid itself.
- Calculated data point validity is no longer gated by MASTER sources. Applying the
  ADR-0025 reasoning to calculated data points, only the readable VALUES sources
  (`_relevant_values_data_points`) are state carriers; MASTER paramset entries such as
  `LOW_BAT_LIMIT` are configuration inputs that a sleeping battery device may never
  deliver, and previously blocked `is_valid`, `is_refreshed` and `state_uncertain` of the
  whole calculated data point. A calculated data point without any readable VALUES source
  is now invalid rather than valid-with-`None`.

### Documentation

- **Events reference for the Home Assistant integration**
  (`docs/user/features/homeassistant_events.md`, EN + DE): Documents all seven
  events the integration fires on the HA event bus — `homematic.keypress`,
  `homematic.impulse`, `homematic.device_error`,
  `homematic.device_availability`, `homematicip_local.optimistic_rollback`,
  `homematicip_local.central_state_changed` and
  `homematicip_local.interface_connection_changed` — with their triggering
  parameters and complete payloads. The user guide's `Events` section previously
  described three of them in one sentence each and named neither the triggering
  parameters nor any payload field, so which parameter surfaces as which event
  was not answerable from the docs (aiohomematic#3333). It now carries an
  overview table and links to the new page.
- **Service messages are explicitly documented as non-events**: CCU service
  messages (`CONFIG_PENDING`, `UPDATE_PENDING`, `STICKY_UNREACH`) never produce
  a `device_error` event, and their parameters are hidden, so they yield no
  entity either. The new page points to the `hub_service_messages` sensor as the
  supported way to consume them, including an example automation. This was the
  concrete misunderstanding behind aiohomematic#3333.

# Version 2026.8.0 (2026-08-01)

## What's Changed

### Added

- `AI_POLICY.md` documenting the project's policy on AI-assisted contributions,
  linked from `docs/contributor/contributing.md`.

### Changed

- **Minimum `openccu-data` raised to 2026.7.2**, picking up the current CCU
  translation and easymode artifacts. The package is pulled in transitively, so
  upgrading aiohomematic is sufficient.
- **`_GenericProperty.__init__` now takes `cached` and `log_context` as
  keyword-only arguments**, in line with the project-wide keyword-only
  convention. All in-tree call sites already pass them by keyword; only code
  that constructs `_GenericProperty` with more than four positional arguments is
  affected.
- Unhandled task exceptions are logged via `_LOGGER.error(..., exc_info=exc)`
  instead of `_LOGGER.exception()`. `_log_task_exception` runs from a task
  done-callback, i.e. outside an active exception handler, where `exception()`
  has no ambient `sys.exc_info()` to draw on. Log level and traceback output are
  unchanged.

# Version 2026.7.11 (2026-07-24)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **XML-RPC commands no longer hang forever when a connection goes half-open**:
  The operational XML-RPC proxy is now created with a socket timeout
  (`timeout_config.rpc_timeout`, 60 s by default), matching backend detection.
  Previously the proxy was created without a timeout, so a silently dropped or
  half-open (TLS) keep-alive connection made a `setValue`/`putParamset` request
  block indefinitely in the proxy's single worker thread. Because each interface
  has exactly one worker, that wedged the interface's entire outgoing command
  path — commands were neither sent nor failed, the only visible symptom being
  the 30 s optimistic rollback — until Home Assistant was restarted. Incoming
  events kept flowing the whole time, since they arrive over the separate
  callback path. With the timeout in place, a stuck request now aborts as a
  retryable `NoConnectionException`, freeing the worker thread and letting the
  command retry handler react.

# Version 2026.7.10 (2026-07-20)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Multi-channel postfix no longer overrides unique custom channel names**: The
  `ch<no>` postfix for parameters that exist on multiple channels of a device is
  now only appended when the channel name alone does not identify the channel —
  i.e. for device-derived names, names following the `<name>:<no>` scheme, or
  when several channels providing the same parameter share the same custom name.
  A channel with a unique custom name (e.g. a status channel named
  `<sub device> Status`) keeps its clean data point name again.

### Added

- New `get_channel_nos_for_parameter()` on `ParamsetDescriptionProviderProtocol`
  and `ParamsetDescriptionRegistry` returning the channel numbers of a device
  that provide a parameter.

# Version 2026.7.9 (2026-07-19)

## What's Changed

### Added

- New `aiohomematic.device_semantics` module exposing the curated
  device-semantics classifications from openccu-data (>= 2026.7.0).
  First classification: `DOORBELL_MODELS` (`HM-Sen-DB-PCB`,
  `HmIP-DBB`, `HmIP-DSD-PCB`) — the shared source of truth for
  consumers that map the ring press onto their platform's doorbell
  semantics (homematicip_local's ring event type, openccu-loom's MQTT
  HA discovery).

# Version 2026.7.8 (2026-07-18)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Issue-Analyzer bot refocused from diagnosis to triage.** An audit of all 181
  bot-commented issues showed the LLM root-cause analyses were fully correct in
  only 18% of cases and outright wrong in 24% (16% correct on issues that turned
  out to be real, code-fixed bugs), while the data-collection parts were the
  reliably useful ones. `.github/scripts/analyze_issue.py` no longer posts
  attachment-analysis findings, LLM version judgments, or "critical" banners.
  What remains is deterministic: template-field parsing (the version is read from
  the issue-form field instead of a body-wide regex), a version check against the
  actually published releases (neutral wording, tolerant of shortened versions),
  attachment/screenshot/inline-log detection, AI-paste detection, and the
  `needs-raw-data` label maintenance. Claude is only asked for a 2-sentence
  summary, up to 2 documentation links, duplicate-search terms, and routing flags
  (device-related, feature request) — with the current date in the prompt and an
  explicit no-diagnosis rule. The model is overridable via the `ANALYZER_MODEL`
  repository variable.

### Fixed

- **"Similar issues" section actually searches now.** `search_similar_issues()`
  listed the 5 most recently updated issues and never applied the search term
  (2 of 169 audited lists were topically relevant). It now queries the GitHub
  search API with a deterministically extracted device model plus LLM-suggested
  terms.
- **Issue-Analyzer crash on search terms with zero hits.** Slicing the PyGithub
  `PaginatedList` returned by `search_issues()` (`results[:3]`) probes by index
  and raises `IndexError` when the search comes back empty, aborting the whole
  analyzer run before a comment is posted. The result is now consumed with
  `itertools.islice`, which iterates lazily and stops cleanly on empty result
  sets; the test fake mimics the real `PaginatedList` slice semantics so this
  cannot regress silently.

### Added

- **Guardrails for the insufficient-information close workflow.**
  `close-insufficient-info.yml` now refuses to close an issue when attachments,
  screenshots or inline log excerpts are present, when the issue carries a
  feature-request label, or when the reporter has had less than 72 hours since
  the `needs-raw-data` label was applied (or issue creation). A `force` input
  overrides the guardrails.

# Version 2026.7.7 (2026-07-16)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **`DataPointCategory.ALARM_CONTROL_PANEL` / `DataPointType.ALARM_CONTROL_PANEL`
  — loom-only vocabulary.** aiohomematic itself never spawns an alarm control
  panel (the CCU has no alarm engine); the members exist so the category
  vocabulary stays in lock-step with `openccu-loom` (daemon ≥ 0.42.0 models the
  panel as a first-class entity) and `homematicip_local` — which derives its HA
  platform list from `CATEGORIES` — mounts the `alarm_control_panel` platform
  for the loom backend. Pure vocabulary: no model class, no behaviour change on
  the CCU path. `CATEGORIES` and `_CATEGORY_TO_DATA_POINT_TYPE` carry the new
  member.

# Version 2026.7.6 (2026-07-10)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Custom data point validity is now gated only by state-carrying fields
  (ADR-0025).** Secondary values (activity/direction readbacks, group-channel
  readbacks, colors, extra sensors, MASTER config values) can stay unrefreshed for
  hours after a CCU restart — nothing re-polls them — and previously dragged the whole
  custom data point to `is_valid=False`, leaving Home Assistant entities stuck in
  `value_state=restored` (covers; same class as climate #3255/#3279). Every
  custom data point class now declares its validity-relevant fields in a single
  declarative `_validity_relevant_fields` set (cover/blind/dimmer: `LEVEL`;
  switch/valve/access permission: `STATE`; garage: `DOOR_STATE`; locks:
  `LOCK_STATE`/`STATE`/`BUTTON_LOCK`; climate: `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` + setpoint + mode
  source; sirens: alarm-active states; sound player: `ACTIVITY_STATE`). The climate
  blocklist `_validity_irrelevant_data_points` (#3255) and the per-class
  `_relevant_data_points` overrides (blind `LEVEL_2`, RGBW operation-mode allowlist,
  DALI) are replaced by the unified mechanism. A new contract test
  (`tests/contract/test_cdp_validity_contract.py`) pins the field set of all 27
  classes.

# Version 2026.7.5 (2026-07-10)

## What's Changed

### Breaking / Removed

Result of a consumer-surface audit against `homematicip_local` (the sole downstream
consumer): every removal below was verified to have zero direct and zero indirect
usage in the integration. Net effect: −5,800 LOC. Migration guide:
`docs/migrations/simplification_migration_2026_07.md`.

- **Removed the `aiohomematic` console script (`hmcli.py`).** Never imported or
  invoked by any consumer; openccu-loom ships a Go replacement (`cmd/hmcli`).
- **Removed the `HomematicAPI` facade (`aiohomematic/api.py`).** Pure delegation
  layer over `CentralUnit` with zero importers. All docs examples now show the
  real consumer pattern (`CentralConfig` → `create_central()` → `async with central`).
- **Removed `SysvarStateChangedEvent`.** The event had no production publisher and
  its `HubCoordinator` subscription could never fire; consumers update sysvars via
  `sysvar_dp.event(...)` directly.
- **Removed `aiohomematic/tracing.py` and `aiohomematic/logging_context.py`.**
  Zero production imports; `RequestContext` (`context.py`) and `LogContextMixin`
  remain.
- **Flattened 37 zero-use ISP slice protocols in `aiohomematic.interfaces`**
  (protocol count 120 → 83). Composite protocols (`ClientProtocol`,
  `CentralProtocol`, `DeviceProtocol`, `ChannelProtocol`) keep their exact member
  sets (AST-verified); every protocol name imported by `homematicip_local` is
  unchanged.
- **Removed the Kind/payload property metadata subsystem** (`Kind`,
  `config_property`/`info_property`/`state_property`, `get_hm_property_by_kind`,
  `PayloadMixin`, `PayloadProtocol`, `Device.info`, `alt_name=`/`kind=`
  parameters). Its only consumption chain ended in `Device.info`, which had zero
  readers. `hm_property(cached=…, log_context=…)` and `DelegatedProperty` remain;
  new `get_hm_property_names()` helper lists decorated property names.

### Fixed

- **Climate entity for `HmIP-WTH-B` (and other thermostats) no longer fails to load when the
  SETPOINT paramset description is incomplete (#3281).** When a device's SETPOINT paramset
  description carried no `MAX` (e.g. after a failed `getParamsetDescription`),
  `BaseCustomDpClimate.max_temp` returned `None` via an unchecked `cast(float, ...)`. Caching the
  week profile then evaluated `min_temp <= base_temperature <= max_temp` and raised an uncaught
  `TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'float' and 'NoneType'` out of
  `reload_and_cache_schedule`. Since that method only swallows `ValidationException`, the
  `TypeError` propagated into Home Assistant's entity setup, leaving the climate entity permanently
  "unavailable" — while an identical device with a complete paramset description worked fine.
  `max_temp` now falls back to a fixed upper bound (`30.5`) when neither a `TEMPERATURE_MAXIMUM`
  value nor a SETPOINT `MAX` is available, mirroring the existing `min_temp` guard. As defense in
  depth, `ClimateWeekProfile` now validates its temperature bounds and raises a caught
  `ValidationException` instead of a `TypeError` when a bound is missing, so an incomplete paramset
  description degrades gracefully (the entity loads; only the schedule stays uncached). Regression
  and contract tests cover both the `max_temp` fallback and the graceful schedule-conversion
  failure.

# Version 2026.7.4 (2026-07-09)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Valve-only HmIP heating groups no longer freeze `current_temperature`/`current_humidity`
  (#3279).** Follow-up to #3255. `HmIP-HEATING` groups always expose `HUMIDITY` and
  `HEATING_COOLING` on the group channel, but only a group containing a wall thermostat
  (`HmIP-WTH`/`STHD`) ever receives events for them. In a group built from valves alone
  (`HmIP-eTRV`) those readable data points never refresh — and since #3228 `VirtualDevices`
  get no `getValue` fallback — so they dragged the whole custom climate data point to
  `is_valid=False`, leaving Home Assistant in `value_state=restored` and freezing
  `current_temperature` at the last (re)start value even though `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` kept
  arriving via events. #3255 only excluded the actuator values `LEVEL`/`STATE` from the climate
  validity check; `CustomDpIpThermostat._validity_irrelevant_data_points` now also excludes
  `HUMIDITY` and `HEATING_COOLING`, so a group's climate validity follows its aggregated
  `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` regardless of whether a wall thermostat is present. A regression test
  covers a valve-only group whose `HUMIDITY`/`HEATING_COOLING` never refresh.

# Version 2026.7.3 (2026-07-08)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **HmIP-LSC now exposes color temperature in addition to color** (#3277). The
  HmIP-LSC LED strip controller uses RGBW hardware but, unlike the HmIP-RGBW, has
  no `DEVICE_OPERATION_MODE` parameter, so it was handled by the mode-based
  `CustomDpIpRGBWLight` and fell back to the `RGBW` mode — advertising only `hs`
  color even though `COLOR_TEMPERATURE` works. The HmIP-LSC supports full color
  _and_ color temperature and switches between them at runtime; the device reports
  the currently inactive mode as an empty value (`COLOR_TEMPERATURE` while a color
  is set, `HUE` while a color temperature is set). A dedicated
  `CustomDpIpRGBWColorTempLight` now advertises both color modes statically (via
  `LightCapabilities.hs_color`/`color_temperature`) and derives the active color
  mode from which value the device reports — mirroring how Home Assistant's own
  tplink/LIFX integrations handle lights that support both modes. The HmIP-RGBW is
  unchanged and keeps its `DEVICE_OPERATION_MODE`-based behavior.

# Version 2026.7.2 (2026-07-08)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **CUxD/CCU-Jack devices no longer go unavailable after init.** The
  per-parameter `getValue` fallback that runs on init when a value is missing from the
  bulk cache was still active for the JSON-RPC interfaces CUxD and CCU-Jack. Since
  #3228 the bulk fetch skips not-yet-measured values (cache miss) and additionally loads
  each data point's paired `*_STATUS`, roughly doubling the fallback traffic. For CUxD/
  CCU-Jack every `getValue` performs a `Session.login`, so this flooded the CCU's
  JSON-RPC session pool (`too many sessions` / `invalid credentials`), and the affected
  devices were marked unavailable in Home Assistant. CUxD/CCU-Jack are now added to the
  new `INTERFACES_SKIPPING_INIT_GETVALUE_FALLBACK` set (alongside VirtualDevices and
  BidCos-RF): the fallback is skipped and values arrive via the bulk
  `get_all_device_data` fetch and MQTT events, as intended. Added a contract test
  pinning CUxD/CCU-Jack to this behavior.
- **JSON-RPC session login is no longer raced on cold start.** `_login_or_renew`
  was unguarded, so a burst of concurrent callers at init (all seeing `session_id is
None`) each performed a `Session.login`, creating several CCU sessions at once and
  contributing to the `too many sessions` limit. Login/renew is now serialized with an
  `asyncio.Lock` (with a lock-free fast path for a recently refreshed session), so a
  cold-start burst results in exactly one login that the other callers reuse.

# Version 2026.7.1 (2026-07-03)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **User access permission switches for HmIP-DLD and HmIP-FWI (#3262).** These
  access-control devices now expose their per-user access channels (HmIP-DLD
  `:2`–`:9`, HmIP-FWI `:1`–`:8`) as switch data points, mirroring the
  `PERMISSION_STATE` switches added for the newer HmIP-DLP. Unlike the DLP — which
  has a single read/write `PERMISSION_STATE` parameter — these devices split the
  permission into a read-only `STATE` and a write-only `ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION` (ENUM
  `DISABLE`/`ENABLE`). The new `CustomDpIpAccessPermission` custom data point
  combines both into one switch: `value` reflects `STATE`, `turn_on`/`turn_off`
  write `ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION`. Added the `IP_ACCESS_PERMISSION` device profile and
  the `ACCESS_AUTHORIZATION` `Parameter`/`Field`. The profile keeps the devices'
  unrelated data points (HmIP-FWI access codes, output switches, week program) via
  `allow_undefined_generic_data_points`.

### Fixed

- **BidCos-RF no longer fills not-yet-refreshed VALUES with getValue defaults
  (#3260).** Passive/battery BidCos-RF devices cannot be actively queried, so the
  per-parameter `getValue` fallback during init returned the paramset default (marked
  as valid) instead of a real reading — masking an actually uncertain state for devices
  that had not reported yet. As already done for VirtualDevices (#3228), the `getValue`
  fallback is now skipped for the BidCos-RF interface: readable VALUES keep their
  (unset) `NO_VALUE` state until a real value arrives via event. The bulk ReGa fetch
  (which filters placeholders via `LastTimestamp`) remains the trustworthy init source.

# Version 2026.6.9 (2026-06-30)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Heating-group `climate` no longer freezes `current_temperature`/`current_humidity`
  (#3255).** For `HmIP-HEATING` groups (VirtualDevices interface) the CCU never sends
  events for the actuator values `LEVEL`/`STATE`/`VALVE_STATE`, and since the #3228
  fixes the `getValue` fallback returns `NO_VALUE` for VirtualDevices. Those readable
  data points therefore stayed unrefreshed forever and dragged the whole custom climate
  data point to `is_valid=False`, so Home Assistant kept the climate entity in
  `value_state=restored` and froze `current_temperature`/`current_humidity` at the value
  loaded on the last (re)start — while the sibling `sensor.*` entities (gated on their own
  data point) kept updating. The climate validity check now ignores these actuator/activity
  data points: `BaseCustomDpClimate` exposes a `_validity_irrelevant_data_points` hook,
  with `CustomDpIpThermostat` excluding `LEVEL`/`STATE` and `CustomDpRfThermostat`
  excluding `VALVE_STATE`. The values themselves are unaffected (they still arrive via
  events when the CCU sends them); only the validity/`value_state` gating changes.

# Version 2026.6.8 (2026-06-24)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **`HmIP-FWI` `CODE_ID` no longer drops the idle value 31 (#3238).** The CCU declares
  `MAX=21` for the fingerprint reader's `CODE_ID`, but the device reports `CODE_ID=31`
  in idle/standby. The too-low maximum dropped the idle value at the Home Assistant
  `number` entity, so `number.*_code_id` kept the last recognized code (e.g. 21) and
  never returned to 31, while the sibling `sensor.*_code_state` updated correctly.
  A paramset patch now widens `CODE_ID` `MAX` to 31 for `HmIP-FWI`. This fixes the
  event-driven flow (device-reported codes); it is unrelated to the optimistic
  send/rollback path addressed in 2026.6.7. The paramset cache schema version was
  bumped to 4 so the corrected bounds are rebuilt from the CCU.

# Version 2026.6.7 (2026-06-23)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **A failed collector send now rolls back optimistic values immediately instead of
  after the 30 s timeout (#3238).** The direct-send path in
  `GenericDataPoint.send_value()` already rolled back the optimistic value when the
  backend `set_value` raised (e.g. an XML-RPC `RESPONSE_NAK` after all retries were
  exhausted), but the collector path (`CallParameterCollector.send_data()`) did not.
  As a result, a write the CCU rejected left the optimistic value active for the full
  `optimistic_update_timeout` (30 s), so the entity kept displaying the value that
  never reached the device until the timeout rollback fired. `_send_paramset` now
  mirrors the direct-send path: on a send error it immediately rolls back the
  optimistic values of the data points contained in the failed paramset
  (`reason=send_error`). The rollback entry point `_rollback_optimistic_value` was
  promoted to the public `rollback_optimistic_value` so the collector can invoke it.

# Version 2026.6.6 (2026-06-23)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **`VirtualDevices` no longer report an implausible `0` after a CCU restart via
  the `getValue` fallback (#3228).** The previous attempts (`*_STATUS` load-path,
  ReGa script v2.5) could not fix this case: a virtual heating group's
  `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` is aggregated by the CCU and has **no physical device**
  behind it, so the per-parameter `getValue` fallback can only ever return the
  CCU-internal default (`0`) — and the CCU reports it with `*_STATUS = NORMAL`
  (the status default), not `UNKNOWN`, so the status check never rejected it.
  Because `getValue` cannot deliver a device-fresh value for an interface without
  a backing device, the `VALUES` `getValue` fallback is now **skipped entirely for
  `VirtualDevices`**. The bulk ReGa fetch — which already gates these data points
  on a valid `LastTimestamp()` (v2.5) — becomes the single source of truth, and the
  data point stays unavailable until a real reading arrives via event. Physical
  interfaces are unaffected: there `getValue` can read the device, so the fallback
  is retained.

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Bulk-load ReGa script reworked (v2.5) to stop emitting a `0` placeholder at
  the source (#3228).** The `2026.6.3` change (#3229) had replaced the empty-value
  coercion with a skip via `if (vDPValue == "") { bHasValue = false }`. In ReGa an
  operation's type is determined by the left operand, and an empty string coerces
  to `0` — so `vDPValue == ""` is also true for every numeric `0`/`0.0`. That skip
  therefore dropped _all_ legitimate zero readings from the bulk result (not just
  not-yet-measured ones), forcing a `getValue` fallback per zero. The script now
  (a) gates `VirtualDevices` data points on a valid `LastTimestamp()` so heating
  groups that carry a `Timestamp()` but no real reading after a CCU restart stay
  out of the bulk result entirely, and (b) coerces an empty value to `0` only when
  it is a genuine _string_ script variable (`VarType() == 4`), preserving real
  numeric zeros. This pairs with the `2026.6.4` `*_STATUS` load-path fix (#3233).

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Issue reports now ask for raw data, not pasted AI analyses.** The bug-report
  issue templates (English and German) and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now state that
  meaningful support requires the raw integration diagnostics (`.json`) and debug
  log — **not** a summary or diagnosis produced by an AI tool
  (ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot/…) — and add a required checkbox confirming the raw
  files were attached instead of an AI analysis. The automated issue-analyzer bot
  additionally detects a pasted AI analysis, posts a gentle redirect hint, and
  maintains a `needs-raw-data` triage label (added when the diagnostics/log are
  missing or an AI analysis is detected, removed once the data is provided).

### Fixed

- **Fix sensors still showing an implausible `0` after a CCU restart via the
  `getValue` path (#3228).** The `2026.6.3` ReGa-script fix only covered the
  bulk-load path; the placeholder actually arrives through the per-parameter
  `getValue` fallback (e.g. for virtual heating groups), which returns the
  parameter default (`0`) with `*_STATUS = UNKNOWN` while the CCU has no measured
  value yet. The paired `*_STATUS` parameter is now loaded on init (previously it
  was only updated via later events), and a freshly loaded default whose status is
  `UNKNOWN` no longer overwrites an already known value — the last value is kept
  until a confirmed reading arrives. Restoring a real value after restart
  (cover/dimmer `LEVEL`, #2630) is unaffected: `UNKNOWN` stays valid and the value
  is simply retained.

# Version 2026.6.3 (2026-06-18)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Sensors no longer report a spurious `0` after a CCU restart** (#3228): the
  `fetch_all_device_data.fn` ReGa bulk-load script coerced an **empty**
  (not-yet-measured) numeric value into `"0"`. After a restart a data point
  such as `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE` can already carry a timestamp but no real reading
  yet; the script then emitted `0`, which was cached and shown as a confirmed
  value (e.g. `0 °C`, or `0`/closed for a cover's `LEVEL`). The script now
  **skips** empty values instead of coercing them to `0`, so the data point
  stays unset (`is_valid` stays `False`) and Home Assistant keeps the restored
  last value until the device delivers a real measurement. A real `0` reading is
  unaffected (it is numeric `0`, not an empty value).

# Version 2026.6.2 (2026-06-10)

## What's Changed

### Reverted

- PR #3214: Feature/contract extraction

# Version 2026.6.1 (2026-06-04)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Device creation could be abandoned silently when interrupted.**
  `DeviceCoordinator.create_devices()` builds devices in a loop and only
  dispatches them (via the `DEVICES_CREATED` system event) after the loop
  finishes. The per-device error handling caught `Exception` but not
  `BaseException`, so a `CancelledError` mid-loop — e.g. when Home Assistant
  cancels a slow config-entry setup, or when the event loop is blocked past its
  timeout — abandoned the run with **no log entry**: already-built devices
  stayed in the registry but were never dispatched, leaving the integration
  with zero entities and no diagnostic. The loop is now wrapped in a
  `try/finally` that logs a clear warning (with build progress) when the run is
  interrupted, without altering exception propagation. This makes the failure
  observable; the underlying interruption still needs to be addressed at its
  source (#3213).

# Version 2026.6.0 (2026-06-01)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **HmIP-RGBW / HmIP-DRG-DALI cannot be switched on (briefly flashes, then
  turns off again).** Since #3111 the base `CustomDpDimmer.turn_on` sent the
  `ON_TIME` "not used" sentinel (`DURATION_VALUE=111600`, `DURATION_UNIT=H`) on
  every plain turn_on for any light whose `ON_TIME` field carries a unit. That
  reset is only required for signal lights (`CustomDpIpFixedColorLight`); for
  HmIP-RGBW / HmIP-DRG-DALI the device interprets the sentinel duration on a
  plain turn_on and switches off again immediately. The reset is now gated by a
  `_resets_on_time_on_turn_on` class flag that is only enabled for signal
  lights, restoring the pre-#3111 behaviour for RGBW/DRG-DALI (a lone `LEVEL`
  is sent again). Turn_on with an explicit `on_time`/`ramp_time` is unaffected
  (#3210).

# Version 2026.5.11 (2026-05-29)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Blocking file I/O in the event loop on first easymode access.** The
  easymode metadata store (`aiohomematic/easymode_data.py`) loaded its
  gzip-compressed archive lazily on the first `get_*()` call. When that first
  access happened inside the asyncio event loop (e.g. Home Assistant's
  `ws_get_form_schema` → schema generation), the `read_bytes()` archive read
  blocked the loop and triggered Home Assistant's blocking-call warning. The
  archive is now loaded eagerly at import time — mirroring `ccu_translations` —
  so all later lookups are pure dict reads with no I/O.

# Version 2026.5.10 (2026-05-24)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Switch/cover/valve schedule round-trip fails when the CCU paramset
  includes fields the device category doesn't support.** Reading a schedule
  for a switch (e.g. HmIP-PSMCO) populated `ramp_time` whenever the MASTER
  paramset advertised `RAMP_TIME_BASE` / `RAMP_TIME_FACTOR`, even though the
  field has no semantic effect for switches. The subsequent
  `set_schedule()` then re-validated the same payload with a SWITCH domain
  context and rejected the very entries the read path had just emitted —
  breaking the schedule editor as soon as the user added or modified an
  entry. `convert_raw_group_to_simple_entry` now clears
  `ramp_time` / `level_2` / `duration` for the categories whose validators
  forbid them (SWITCH, LIGHT, COVER, VALVE, LOCK), mirroring
  `_validate_*_entry`. Covered by a new
  `tests/contract/test_schedule_round_trip_contract.py`.

# Version 2026.5.9 (2026-05-13)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Central stuck in `FAILED` after a startup-failure recovery succeeds**
  ([#3183](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/discussions/3183)).
  Follow-up to 2026.5.8: the heartbeat-driven recovery path
  (`_recover_all_interfaces`) reconnected every interface, but the central
  state never left `FAILED`. The central state machine only allows
  `FAILED → RECOVERING` (not `FAILED → RUNNING` / `FAILED → DEGRADED`), so
  the final `_transition_to_running()` / `_transition_to_degraded()`
  silently no-op'd. The heartbeat path now hops through `RECOVERING`
  before running the stages and keeps `_active_recoveries` populated
  while the stages run, matching the proactive `_start_recovery()` path.
  Symptom: even after the CCU came up and the reconnect log lines all
  succeeded, every entity stayed unavailable until the integration was
  reloaded.

# Version 2026.5.8 (2026-05-13)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Automatic reconnect after startup failure when the CCU is not yet
  reachable** ([#3183](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/discussions/3183)).
  When `start_clients()` fails because no interface is reachable, the
  central transitions `INITIALIZING → FAILED` and the
  `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator` is supposed to enter the heartbeat-retry
  loop that re-attempts client creation every 60 s. In practice the
  heartbeat never started, because `EventBus.publish()` used an `or`
  short-circuit between key-specific and wildcard subscribers: as soon as
  the Home Assistant integration registered a key-specific subscriber for
  `CentralStateChangedEvent` (keyed by `central_name`), wildcard
  subscribers — including the recovery coordinator's — were silently
  skipped. Both `publish()` and `publish_batch()` now invoke the **union**
  of specific-key and wildcard subscribers, merged in priority order, so
  wildcard subscribers genuinely observe every event of the type. This
  was visible whenever Home Assistant started before the CCU was ready:
  all entities stayed unavailable until the integration was manually
  reloaded.

# Version 2026.5.7 (2026-05-12)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **HmIP dimmer brightness reflects the state channel instead of the
  commanded value** ([#3181](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3181)).
  The #3166 work routed dimmer reads through `_effective_level`, which
  prefers `_dp_group_level` as the stable status source. For RF dimmers
  that channel carries `LEVEL_REAL`, a 1:1 mirror of the action channel.
  For HmIP dimmers it carries `LEVEL` on the primary-1 channel — and that
  value's semantics are device-specific. On HmIP-FDT for example channel 1
  echoes a section summary instead of a mirror, so HA briefly showed the
  summary value instead of what the user commanded (all dimmer channels
  appearing to take the value of channel 1). `_effective_level` now keeps
  the #3166 mirror logic only for RF dimmers
  (`group_level.parameter == LEVEL_REAL`) and falls back to the action
  channel directly for HmIP, restoring the 2.7.0 behaviour for those
  devices.

# Version 2026.5.6 (2026-05-12)

## What's Changed

### Added

- Expose `inbox_dp` and `update_dp` as `DelegatedProperty` on `HubCoordinator`
  (parallel to existing `alarm_messages_dp`/`service_messages_dp` etc.). Lets
  external consumers enumerate the full set of hub-backed singleton data
  points without reaching into the private `_hub` attribute. Required by the
  homematicip_local orphan-cleanup sweep so that hub-only entities (inbox,
  system update, …) are no longer wrongly classified as orphans on every
  restart.

### Fixed

- **Brief dimmer flicker between action-channel and state-channel final
  echoes** ([#3177](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3177)
  third follow-up). After the CCU finished a ramp, the action channel
  echoed the final LEVEL value a few milliseconds before the state channel
  caught up with LEVEL_REAL. In that small window the regular tracker had
  already been cleared by the matching action-channel echo, and
  `_effective_level` fell back to the still-stale `_dp_group_level`, briefly
  flipping `is_on` back to the previous state and producing a spurious
  `ausgeschaltet -> eingeschaltet -> ausgeschaltet` entry in HA's history.
  `_effective_level` now picks whichever of `_dp_level` and
  `_dp_group_level` was modified more recently, so the fresh action-channel
  echo wins until the state channel catches up. Equally fresh values still
  prefer the state channel, preserving the #3166 behaviour during a ramp.

# Version 2026.5.5 (2026-05-12)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Dimmer flicker during ramp not fully fixed by 2026.5.4**
  ([#3177](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3177) follow-up).
  The 2026.5.4 fix relied on `unconfirmed_last_value_send` as a fallback for
  `_effective_level`, but the underlying tracker was only populated AFTER
  the backend call returned. An echo dispatched while we were still
  awaiting `throttle.acquire()` or the backend `setValue` response would
  clear the optimistic state via `_values_mismatch()` while the tracker
  was still empty — `_effective_level()` then fell back to the stale
  `_dp_group_level` (`LEVEL_REAL` on RF dimmers), reproducing the brief
  flicker the user kept reporting after 2026.5.4. The fix introduces a
  small `_in_flight_commands` map on the `InterfaceClient` that is
  populated synchronously BEFORE the first suspend point in `set_value` /
  `put_paramset` and dropped in a `finally` once the backend returns or
  raises. `unconfirmed_last_value_send` now consults this map first and
  falls back to the regular `CommandTracker` afterwards. The in-flight
  store is intentionally separate from the tracker so that a matching
  echo cannot clear it mid-send.

# Version 2026.5.4 (2026-05-11)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Dimmer `is_on` briefly flips back to the previous state during a ramp**
  ([#3177](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3177)). The fix for
  #3165 (#3166) routed dimmer reads through `_effective_level`, which prefers
  `_dp_group_level` (LEVEL_REAL on RF dimmers, the state-channel LEVEL on HmIP
  dimmers) as the stable status source. On RF dimmers (e.g.
  `HM-LC-Dim1PWM-CV`) LEVEL_REAL only updates **after** the ramp finishes,
  while the action-channel LEVEL receives an intermediate value almost
  immediately. That intermediate echo cleared the optimistic state via
  `_values_mismatch`, after which the fallback returned the stale pre-command
  LEVEL_REAL — flipping `is_on`/`brightness` back to the previous state until
  the final echo arrived (visible as `off → on → off` when turning the light
  off, and `on → off → on` when turning it on). `_effective_level` now
  consults `_dp_level.unconfirmed_last_value_send` between the optimistic
  state and the group-level fallback, so the sent target stays authoritative
  until the CCU echoes a matching value. `_commanded_brightness` and
  `_commanded_is_on` share the same source for consistency between
  `state_property` reads and `is_state_change` checks.

# Version 2026.5.3 (2026-05-10)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **`HmIP-RGBW`/`HmIP-DRG-DALI` `turn_off` with `transition` rejected by CCU**
  ([#3172](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3172)). Since
  `2026.4.7` (#3112) `CustomDpIpRGBWLight.turn_off` and
  `CustomDpIpDrgDaliLight.turn_off` overrode the base implementation to send
  `RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_VALUE`/`RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_UNIT` instead of
  `RAMP_TIME_VALUE`/`RAMP_TIME_UNIT` in the off `putParamset`. The CCU rejects
  this combination with a generic `MISSING_NON_OPTIONAL_PARAMETER` XMLRPC
  fault, so the call was retried three times and the light never actually
  turned off. The optimistic `LEVEL=0.0` written before the retries also
  caused the next `turn_off` (without `transition`) to be skipped by
  `is_state_change`, requiring a second click. The `RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_*`
  overrides and the unused `_dp_ramp_time_to_off` combined timer field have
  been removed; the inherited `CustomDpDimmer` implementation now handles
  `turn_off(ramp_time=…)` with the CCU-accepted
  `RAMP_TIME_VALUE`/`RAMP_TIME_UNIT` parameters again (the `2026.4.6`
  behavior).

# Version 2026.5.2 (2026-05-10)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **HmIP `LOWBAT` not reflected in `MaintenanceData.low_bat`**. The
  `ConfigurationCoordinator.get_configurable_devices` channel-0 sweep only
  recognised `LOW_BAT` (HM/BidCos) and lower-cased the parameter name to
  derive the `MaintenanceData` field, so HmIP devices — which report the
  low-battery indicator as `LOWBAT` (no underscore) — were silently dropped
  and `maintenance.low_bat` stayed `None`. Both `LOW_BAT` and `LOWBAT` now
  map explicitly to the `low_bat` field via a dedicated
  `_MAINTENANCE_PARAM_TO_FIELD` table, so HmIP devices report low-battery
  state to consumers (e.g. the homematicip_local config panel) correctly.

# Version 2026.5.1 (2026-05-06)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Climate `activity` reports `HEAT` in cooling mode**
  ([#3164](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3164)). With an
  HmIP-WTH-1 wall thermostat linked to an HmIP-FALMOT-C12 valve actuator and
  the operation mode set to cooling, the climate entity wrongly reported
  `heating` as the current activity. `CustomDpIpThermostat.activity` returned
  `ClimateActivity.HEAT` unconditionally on the `LEVEL > 0` branch, ignoring
  `_is_heating_mode`. The branch now mirrors the STATE branch and returns
  `ClimateActivity.HEAT if self._is_heating_mode else ClimateActivity.COOL`.
- **Dimmer light briefly reports intermediate `LEVEL` values during ramps**
  ([#3165](https://github.com/SukramJ/aiohomematic/issues/3165)). Homematic
  RF dimmers (e.g. `HM-LC-Dim1PWM-CV`) emit transient `LEVEL` events while
  the device is ramping up or down — for example a turn-off from 70 % first
  reports `LEVEL=0.69`, then `WORKING=True`, and only at the end of the ramp
  `LEVEL=0.0`. This caused Home Assistant entities (and downstream
  automations) to flicker between target, intermediate, and final values.

  The dimmer custom data point now treats the per-channel `LEVEL_REAL`
  parameter as the authoritative status source for `is_on`, `brightness`,
  and `brightness_pct`, mirroring how HmIP dimmers already use the
  state-channel `LEVEL` (`Field.GROUP_LEVEL`). While an optimistic command
  is pending, the optimistic target on `LEVEL` still takes precedence —
  so the immediate UI feedback after a turn-on/turn-off is unaffected.
  `is_state_change` and the implicit brightness fallback in `turn_on()` keep
  using the commanded `LEVEL`, so redundant commands and brightness
  restoration continue to work as before.

### Changed

- All RF dimmer profiles (`RF_DIMMER`, `RF_DIMMER_COLOR`,
  `RF_DIMMER_COLOR_FIXED`, `RF_DIMMER_COLOR_TEMP`,
  `RF_DIMMER_WITH_VIRT_CHANNEL`) now map `Field.GROUP_LEVEL` to
  `Parameter.LEVEL_REAL` via `visible(...)`, exposing it as a stable group
  status data point analogous to the HmIP-Dimmer state channel.

# Version 2026.5.0 (2026-05-02)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Schedule duration encoding silently clamped on the device**: durations like
  `"40min"` or `"45s"` were encoded with the smallest matching unit
  (`DURATION_BASE=MIN_1`/`SEC_1`) plus a raw factor that exceeded the CCU's
  hard cap of `30`. The firmware then clamped the factor to 31, so a user
  request for "40 minutes" silently became "31 minutes" on the device. The
  encoder now picks the natural `TimeBase` for the input unit and promotes
  to a coarser base only when the factor would overflow, e.g.
  `"40min"` → `(MIN_5, 8)`, `"45s"` → `(SEC_5, 9)`. Existing values whose
  factor already fit (e.g. `"10s"`, `"5min"`, `"1h"`) keep their previous
  encoding.

### Changed

- **`SimpleScheduleEntry` rejects unrepresentable durations at validation
  time** rather than silently clamping on the CCU. Values that exceed
  `factor=30` in every available `TimeBase` (e.g. `"31h"`, `"301s"`) and
  sub-`100ms` granularity (e.g. `"50ms"`) now raise `ValueError` with a
  new i18n key `exception.model.schedule.duration_factor_out_of_range`.
  Use `duration=None` to express "permanent" (no DURATION_BASE/FACTOR
  written to the device).

## What's Changed

### Changed

- Adopt the new [openccu-data](https://github.com/sukramj/openccu-data) package
  (`>=2026.4.1`) as the source-of-truth for CCU translation and easymode
  metadata. Both `ccu_translations.py` and `easymode_data.py` now resolve
  their data files via `importlib.resources` from `openccu_data.data`
  (extract archives) and `openccu_data.data.translation_custom`
  (curated overrides), replacing the previous `pkgutil.get_data` lookups.

### Removed

- Drop the vendored `aiohomematic/ccu_data/` tree (translation extract,
  easymode extract, and all `translation_custom/*.json` overrides) — these
  are now distributed by `openccu-data`.
- Drop `script/lint_translation_custom.py` and the corresponding
  `lint-translation-custom` prek hook; the lint logic moved to
  `openccu-data` together with the custom override files.
- Drop the `ccu_data/*` entries from `package-data` in `pyproject.toml`.

### Migration

Downstream consumers do **not** need to change anything: the public API of
`ccu_translations` and `easymode_data` is unchanged. New dependency
`openccu-data` is pulled in transitively when upgrading. To regenerate the
underlying CCU artifacts, work in the
[openccu-data](https://github.com/sukramj/openccu-data) repository and
publish a new release; aiohomematic picks it up via its version constraint.

# Version 2026.4.19 (2026-04-22)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Further linter tightening** — second pass cross-referenced against the
  Home Assistant core project's `pyproject.toml`:
  - Ruff: added `B009, B017, B024, B025, B035, B905, F541, SLF`, and the
    `RUF007, RUF008, RUF010, RUF016, RUF017, RUF019, RUF020, RUF021,
RUF022, RUF023, RUF024, RUF026, RUF030, RUF032, RUF033, RUF034,
RUF059, RUF101` rules. `B905` now forces `zip(..., strict=...)`,
    `RUF008` catches mutable dataclass defaults, `RUF024` catches mutable
    `dict.fromkeys` values, `RUF022/RUF023` keep `__all__` / `__slots__`
    sorted alphabetically.
  - Ruff: added `flake8-tidy-imports.banned-api` entries for `async_timeout`,
    `pytz`, and `tests`, preventing production code from importing test
    modules.
  - Ruff: files that are intentionally coupled to private state of adjacent
    classes (model `*/field.py` descriptors, `compat.py`'s
    `sys._is_gil_enabled`, `rpc_proxy.py` extending `xmlrpc.client`,
    `rpc_server.py` reading `aiohttp.web.TCPSite._server`, and the
    `connection_recovery` duck-typed introspection paths) are exempted
    from `SLF001` per-file, with the rationale documented in the config.
  - mypy: enabled the `deprecated` error code so calls into APIs annotated
    with `typing_extensions.deprecated` fail type-checking, and turned on
    `strict_bytes` to disallow implicit `bytes` / `str` mixing.
  - pylint: set `fail-on = ["I"]` so informational messages
    (`useless-suppression`, `use-symbolic-message-instead`) now fail the
    check instead of being silently informational. Added a tests
    per-file-ignore pair (`redefined-outer-name`,
    `use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison`) matching the core config.
  - pytest: enabled `asyncio_debug = true` to surface scheduler hazards
    and un-awaited coroutines during the test run.
- **Reconcile `RUF022` with the project's `lint-all-exports` convention**:
  The project's custom `lint-all-exports` hook requires every public
  package `__init__.py` to keep grouped, header-commented `__all__`
  lists (`# GroupName` then alphabetical within each group). Ruff's
  new `RUF022` would sort the whole list alphabetically and break the
  groups, so `RUF022` is disabled for `aiohomematic/**/__init__.py`
  (glob, so future packages are covered automatically) and for
  `central/events/internal.py` which follows the same style. `RUF022`
  still enforces sorting on every other `__all__` in the codebase.
- **Disable `asyncio_debug` for the RPC stress tests**: `asyncio_debug`
  catches scheduler and awaitable hazards across the rest of the suite,
  but its slow-callback logging adds ~2× overhead — enough to break the
  hard-coded timing thresholds in `TestStress::test_concurrent_events`
  / `test_sustained_load` / `test_multicall_batch_performance` (those
  tests measure throughput, not correctness). A class-scoped autouse
  fixture toggles debug mode off for their duration and restores the
  previous setting afterwards.

### Fixed

- **Dead branch in `.github/scripts/analyze_issue.py::_analyze_logs`**:
  both arms of the `len(matches) if isinstance(matches[0], str) else
len(matches)` ternary computed the same value (`RUF034`). Simplified
  to a single `len(matches)` call.

# Version 2026.4.18 (2026-04-21)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Stricter linter configuration**: tightened the project's quality gates.
  - Ruff: full `S` (flake8-bandit) suite activated, `BLE` (blind-except) and
    `PTH` (pathlib) added, `mccabe.max-complexity` lowered from 25 to 15.
    Per-file-ignores extended for tests, `script/`, `.github/scripts/`, and
    top-level examples so only library code is held to the strict bar.
  - mypy: enabled `possibly-undefined` and `unused-awaitable` error codes.
    `explicit-override` intentionally left off — enabling it surfaces ~890
    missing `@override` decorators across protocol implementations and
    belongs in its own dedicated PR.
  - bandit: added 16 additional checks (B104–B107, B303/B304/B310/B311,
    B321/B324, B501–B505, B701). Tests excluded from bandit scope since
    fixture data is intentional; ruff's `S` rules guard production.
- **Migrate filesystem operations to `pathlib`**: `store/storage.py`,
  `support/file_ops.py`, and `model/device.py` now use `pathlib.Path`
  throughout instead of `os.path` / `glob` — clearer semantics for
  `glob` / `resolve` / `replace` operations, no behavior change.
- **Narrow broad exception handlers where the type was obvious**:
  ~25 `except Exception:` blocks in coordinators, client, model, and
  store replaced with concrete exception types (e.g.
  `except (OSError, compat.JSONDecodeError)` for storage I/O,
  `except (ValueError, SyntaxError, MemoryError, TypeError)` for JSON
  parsing, `except AioHomematicException` for project-level RPC calls).
  Intentionally broad catches — incident recording, recovery stages,
  decorator boundaries, calculated data points, service-boundary
  callbacks — now carry a `# noqa: BLE001` with a specific reason
  documenting why narrowing would break the defensive contract.
- **Refactor complex functions for readability**: extracted helpers in
  `central/health.py::health_score` (circuit / activity scoring),
  `central/query_facade.py::get_parameters` (skip / resolve helpers),
  `client/json_rpc.py::get_all_system_variables` (inclusion and record
  builders), `model/schedule_models.py::validate_domain_constraints`
  (per-domain validator dispatch table),
  `model/week_profile.py::convert_raw_to_dict_schedule`, and
  `support/__init__.py::element_matches_key`. Remaining complex
  functions (decorator factories, RPC fault translators, pydantic
  TypedDict serializers) keep a `# noqa: C901` with a concrete reason.

### Fixed

- **`DelegatedProperty` forward-reference type resolution**: using a
  string form (`DelegatedProperty["DeviceRegistry"](...)`) in
  `central/coordinators/device.py::device_registry` caused mypy to
  resolve the attribute as `Any`, which silently masked `no-any-return`
  errors in `devices`, `get_channel`, `get_device`,
  `get_virtual_remotes`, and `identify_channel`. Importing
  `DeviceRegistry` directly and dropping the quotes restores strict
  return-type checking.
- **`Path.mkdir` vs. `os.makedirs` in tests**: after the `pathlib`
  migration, `tests/test_support.py::test_check_or_create_directory_sync`
  still patched `os.path.exists` / `os.makedirs` and no longer intercepted
  calls. Updated to patch `pathlib.Path.exists` / `pathlib.Path.mkdir`.
- **`__new__` return type in `central/rpc_server.py`**: annotated with
  `Self` instead of the concrete class so the `PYI034` contract holds.

---

# Version 2026.4.17 (2026-04-20)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Add device profile for HmIP-UDI-SMI55** (Universal Dimming Interface with motion sensor):
  Registered as IP dimmer on channel 7 (with secondary channels 8/9, state channel 6).
  Motion sensor parameters (MOTION, ILLUMINATION, CURRENT_ILLUMINATION,
  MOTION_DETECTION_ACTIVE, RESET_MOTION) from channel 4 are exposed via
  additional data points. Week profile support on channel 10 is included.
  Battery data (R03/AAA, quantity 2) added to operating voltage level calculation.
- **Add `lint-translation-custom` pre-commit hook**: new
  `script/lint_translation_custom.py` validates every override key in
  `aiohomematic/ccu_data/translation_custom/*.json` against the extracted
  archive, the `Parameter` enum, and known channel-type prefixes. Keys that
  look like `channel_prefix_parameter` typos (where a pipe `|` was required)
  are reported as errors with a concrete fix suggestion; noop overrides
  whose value matches the extract are reported as warnings.

### Fixed

- **HmIP-DLD parameter label "Summer deaktivieren" replaced with
  "Akustische Rückmeldung deaktivieren"**: the custom translation overrides
  for `DISABLE_ACOUSTIC_CHANNELSTATE` and `HOLD_TIME` were keyed as
  `door_lock_disable_acoustic_channelstate` and `door_lock_hold_time`.
  Lookups use `channel_type|parameter` with a pipe separator, so the keys
  never matched and the raw CCU firmware strings ("Summer deaktivieren",
  "Haltezeit beim Öffnen") were forwarded unchanged. The keys are now
  written as plain globals (`disable_acoustic_channelstate`, `hold_time`)
  so the overrides actually apply.

---

# Version 2026.4.16 (2026-04-18)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed HmIP-DLD (and similar devices) silently rejecting schedule updates**:
  `DefaultWeekProfile.set_schedule` unconditionally sent all `WP_*` schedule
  parameters (`WP_CONDITION`, `WP_ASTRO_TYPE`, `WP_ASTRO_OFFSET`, `WP_LEVEL_2`,
  `WP_RAMP_TIME_BASE`, `WP_RAMP_TIME_FACTOR`) to the device. Lock devices like
  HmIP-DLD only advertise a subset of `ScheduleField` in their MASTER paramset
  description — the CCU then silently rejected the entire `putParamset` call,
  leaving `CONFIG_PENDING` set forever. `WeekProfile.supported_schedule_fields`
  now introspects the MASTER paramset description and
  `_filter_raw_schedule_by_supported_fields` drops all unsupported `NN_WP_*`
  keys before `put_paramset`, so device schedule writes only send what the
  device actually accepts.
- **Validate schedule writes against paramset description**: `WeekProfile` write
  paths (`DefaultWeekProfile.set_schedule`, `ClimateWeekProfile.set_schedule`,
  `set_profile`, `copy_schedule_to`) now pass `check_against_pd=True` to
  `put_paramset`, matching the existing behavior of `set_weekday`. Previously,
  unknown or unsupported `WP_*` parameters were forwarded to the CCU without
  validation, where they were silently rejected or caused opaque errors. The
  client now raises a clear `ClientException` listing the offending parameter
  before the request is sent.

### Added

- `WeekProfile.supported_schedule_fields` property (also exposed via
  `WeekProfileDataPoint` and the `WeekProfileProtocol` / `WeekProfileDataPointProtocol`
  protocols) returns the `frozenset[ScheduleField]` that the device advertises
  in its MASTER paramset description. Frontends can inspect this capability
  set (forwarded as `supported_schedule_fields` on the schedule entity
  attributes) to hide non-functional inputs for devices like HmIP-DLD.

# Version 2026.4.15 (2026-04-18)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed `LinkCoordinator.get_linkable_channels` excluding non-CLIMATE channels**:
  `get_link_source_categories` / `get_link_target_categories` only mapped CLIMATE
  roles to a `DataPointCategory`, so channels with `LINK_SOURCE_ROLES` /
  `LINK_TARGET_ROLES` such as `REMOTE_CONTROL` (HmIP-RCV-50), `SWITCH`, `KEYMATIC`,
  `WINMATIC`, `LEVEL`, `WEATHER_*`, `WINDOW_SWITCH*`, etc. produced empty category
  tuples and were filtered out as non-linkable. Added a `_LINK_ROLE_TO_CATEGORY`
  mapping so all known link roles produce a non-empty category. Fixes the
  homematicip-local-frontend "Add Direct Link" wizard not offering the HmIP-RCV-50
  virtual remote (and other non-climate devices) as a target.
- Downgrade log level for unsupported JSON-RPC methods from `error` to `warning`
  in `AioJsonRpcAioHttpClient._check_supported_methods` — missing optional methods
  do not indicate a failure and should not be reported as errors.
- Log instead of silently swallowing `BaseHomematicException` in
  `ConfigurationCoordinator.get_configurable_devices`. Devices whose
  `get_configurable_channels` fails (e.g. due to a missing child description)
  were dropped from the panel device list without any trace. They are still
  skipped, but now emit a warning identifying interface, address, model, and
  the underlying exception, so the root cause can be diagnosed instead of
  hidden. A debug line also explains devices skipped because they have no
  configurable channels.
- **Fixed HmIP-RCV-50 (and similar devices) missing from the panel device list**:
  `DeviceDescriptionRegistry.get_device_with_channels` iterated over every entry
  in the parent's `CHILDREN` array and called `get_device_description` for each.
  Some CCU firmwares (observed with OpenCCU and the virtual remote `HmIP-RCV-50`)
  emit an empty-string entry in `CHILDREN`, causing a
  `DescriptionNotFoundException` that propagated into
  `ConfigurationCoordinator.get_configurable_devices` and removed the whole
  device from the panel list. Empty entries are now skipped, consistent with
  the existing filter in `Device.finalize_init`
  (`aiohomematic/model/device.py:354`).

# Version 2026.4.14 (2026-04-16)

## What's Changed

### Added

- Extract MASTER paramset metadata from CCU WebUI dialog functions (parameter groups, ordering, option presets, conditional visibility)
- Add `ui_labels` translation category for resolving JS translation keys from easymode metadata
- Add `get_ui_label_translation()` to `ccu_translations` public API
- Add `MASTER_SENDER_TYPE` constant and `label_key` field to `ParameterGroupDef` in `easymode_data`

### Fixed

- Fix duplicate conditional visibility entries in easymode extraction

---

# Version 2026.4.13 (2026-04-15)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed schedule target channels for multi-config lock devices (HmIP-DLP,
  HmIP-DLD)**: The schedule UI incorrectly showed all channel groups (e.g.
  channels 0 and 12 for HmIP-DLP) as schedule targets, including the button
  lock which has no schedule. Now only channel groups from CDPs with an explicit
  `schedule_channel_no` are included in the target channel map.

---

# Version 2026.4.12 (2026-04-15)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Lock schedule support for HmIP-DLD and HmIP-DLP**: Added week profile
  (schedule) support for door lock devices.

  - **HmIP-DLD**: `schedule_channel_no=10`, **HmIP-DLP**: `schedule_channel_no=14`
  - **Door lock mode**: 4 lock actions (lock + auto-relock end/start,
    unlock + auto-relock end, auto-relock end) encoded as `lock_action` field
  - **User permission mode**: Permission granted/not granted for
    ACCESS_RECEIVER channels 2-9, encoded as `permission` field
  - **`lock_mode` field**: Distinguishes between `door_lock` and
    `user_permission` modes, derived from `target_channels`
  - **Domain validation**: LOCK domain rejects `level_2`, `ramp_time`, and
    user-set `duration`; enforces mutual exclusivity of `lock_action` and
    `permission` based on `lock_mode`
  - **Level range extended**: `SimpleScheduleEntry.level` now allows 0.0-1.01
    (1.01 is a special lock value for "Auto-Relock End")
  - New enums: `LockAction`, `LockMode`, `LockPermission`

---

# Version 2026.4.11 (2026-04-14)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Command retry mechanism for transient failures**: Introduced
  `CommandRetryHandler` that automatically retries `set_value` and `put_paramset`
  operations on transient errors (network timeouts, device unreachability,
  DutyCycle exhaustion, transmission pending) with exponential backoff.

  - **Retryable errors**: `TimeoutError`, `NoConnectionException`,
    `InternalBackendException`, XML-RPC fault codes -1 (UNREACH), -8
    (INSUFFICIENT_DUTYCYCLE), -9 (DEVICE_OUT_OF_RANGE), -10
    (TRANSMISSION_PENDING).
  - **Non-retryable errors**: `AuthFailure`, `ValidationException`,
    `UnsupportedException`, `CircuitBreakerOpenException`,
    `CommandSupersededError`.
  - **Special delays**: DutyCycle exhaustion uses 40s delay (regeneration
    ~1%/36s), transmission pending uses 5s delay.
  - **Connection recovery awareness**: On `NoConnectionException`, waits for
    `RecoveryCompletedEvent` instead of blind retry. Recovery wait is
    interruptible by cancellation (via `asyncio.wait` with `FIRST_COMPLETED`).
  - **Per-DataPoint supersede**: New command on the same data point cancels
    any pending retry for that data point. Uses cooperative `asyncio.Event`-based
    cancellation — the retry loop checks a cancel event before each attempt and
    during each delay/recovery wait.
  - **Interruptible delays**: `_interruptible_sleep()` wakes immediately on
    cancellation instead of sleeping the full delay.
  - **CRITICAL purge support**: CRITICAL-priority commands (e.g., cover `stop()`)
    cancel all pending retries for the device via `purge_addresses`. Device
    address matching uses `device_address:` prefix to prevent false matches.
  - **Idempotency-safe**: `DpAction` and `DpButton` have `_retryable = False`
    by default (fire-and-forget, non-idempotent). Climate RF thermostat mode
    DpAction calls override with explicit `retry=True` (target-state semantics).
  - **Configurable via `TimeoutConfig`**: `command_retry_max_attempts` (default 3,
    0 = disabled), `command_retry_base_delay`, `command_retry_max_delay`,
    `command_retry_backoff_factor`, `command_retry_duty_cycle_delay`,
    `command_retry_transmission_pending_delay`, `command_retry_recovery_wait`.
  - **Per-call control**: `retry` parameter on `send_value()`, `set_value()`,
    `put_paramset()` allows per-call enable/disable.
  - **Metrics**: `CommandRetryMetrics` tracks total retries, successful retries,
    exhausted retries, recovery waits, timeouts, and cancellations.

### Changed

- **`GenericDataPoint.send_value()`**: New `retry: bool | None = None` parameter.
  `None` uses the class default (`_retryable`), explicit `True`/`False` overrides.
- **`InterfaceClient.set_value()` / `put_paramset()`**: New `retry: bool = True`
  parameter, passed through to `CommandRetryHandler.execute_with_retry()`.
- **`CallParameterCollector`**: Derives retry from collected data points'
  `_retryable` attributes, with explicit override support via `send_value(retry=...)`.
- **Protocol updates**: `ValueOperationsProtocol.set_value()` and
  `ParamsetOperationsProtocol.put_paramset()` include `retry: bool = True`.

# Version 2026.4.10 (2026-04-12)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added `ScheduleChannelSwitch` data point**: New per-channel switch data
  points for enabling/disabling schedule participation on non-climate devices.
  Each target channel gets its own `ScheduleChannelSwitch` instance, registered
  on the schedule channel with `DataPointCategory.SCHEDULE_SWITCH`. The switches
  derive their state from the `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS` bitmask and write via
  `COMBINED_PARAMETER`. They are auto-discovered by Home Assistant as standard
  switch entities, designed to be grouped in a schedule subdevice.

- **Added `ScheduleChannelSwitchProtocol`** in `interfaces/model.py` with
  `value`, `turn_on()`, `turn_off()`, `channel_key`, and `target_channel_info`.

- **Added `DataPointCategory.SCHEDULE_SWITCH`** mapped to `DataPointType.SWITCH`,
  included in the `CATEGORIES` tuple for HA entity discovery.

# Version 2026.4.9 (2026-04-12)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added per-channel schedule enable/disable support for non-climate week
  profiles**: The `WeekProfileDataPoint` now exposes a `schedule_enabled`
  property (returning a `Mapping[str, bool]` of per-channel enabled states) and
  a `set_schedule_enabled()` method with an optional `channel_key` parameter,
  allowing users to activate or deactivate the weekly program per target channel
  on devices that support `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS`. The state is derived
  from the bound `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS` generic data point and
  automatically syncs via event subscription.

- **Added new parameters**: `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS`,
  `WEEK_PROGRAM_TARGET_CHANNEL_LOCK`, and `WEEK_PROGRAM_TARGET_CHANNEL_LOCKS` to
  the `Parameter` enum.

- **Added schedule helper functions**: `channel_key_to_bitmask()` and
  `parse_channel_locks()` in `schedule_models` for converting between channel
  keys and bitmask values used by `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS`.

- **Added channel locks data loading on init**: `WeekProfileDataPoint` now loads
  the `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS` value during `load_data_point_value`, and
  `CustomDataPoint._init_data_point_values` triggers
  `week_profile_data_point.load_data_point_value` to ensure the schedule enabled
  state is available after startup.

### Fixed

- **Fixed visibility rules for WEEK_PROGRAM parameters**: Removed the blanket
  `WEEK_PROGRAM_` prefix pattern from `IGNORED_PARAMETERS_START_PATTERN` so that
  `WEEK_PROGRAM_CHANNEL_LOCKS` and related parameters are no longer hidden.
  `WEEK_PROGRAM_POINTER` is now explicitly listed in `IGNORED_PARAMETERS` to
  preserve its previous hidden behavior.

# Version 2026.4.8 (2026-04-11)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed missing DURATION_UNIT/DURATION_VALUE in turn_off for lights with
  ramp_time**: When `turn_off(ramp_time=...)` is called on lights with timer
  unit parameters (HmIP-BSL, HmIP-RGBW, HmIPW-WRC6, HmIP-DRG-DALI),
  `DURATION_UNIT` and `DURATION_VALUE` are now always included in the
  `putParamset` call, matching the behavior already implemented for `turn_on`.
  This prevents XMLRPCFault errors and optimistic rollbacks when turning off
  lights with a transition time.

# Version 2026.4.7 (2026-04-10)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed missing DURATION_UNIT/DURATION_VALUE in putParamset for signal
  lights**: Devices with timer unit parameters (HmIP-BSL, HmIP-RGBW,
  HmIPW-WRC6) now always include `DURATION_UNIT` and `DURATION_VALUE` in
  `putParamset` calls during `turn_on`. When no explicit `on_time` is set, the
  permanent marker (DV=31, DU=H) is sent as default, matching CCU expectations
  and preventing XMLRPCFault errors.

- **Fixed RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF usage for RGBW and DRG-DALI lights**: The
  `turn_off()` method of `CustomDpIpRGBWLight` and `CustomDpIpDrgDaliLight` now
  correctly uses `RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_UNIT`/`RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_VALUE` instead of
  `RAMP_TIME_UNIT`/`RAMP_TIME_VALUE` when a ramp time is provided during
  turn-off, matching CCU WebUI behavior.

- **Fixed siren duration always sent on turn_on**: `CustomDpIpSiren.turn_on()`
  now falls back to `send_default()` when no duration value is available,
  ensuring `DURATION_UNIT`/`DURATION_VALUE` are always included in the
  putParamset call, consistent with CCU WebUI behavior.

### Added

- **Added `has_unit` property to `CombinedDpTimerAction`**: Indicates whether
  the timer has a unit data point, used to determine if duration defaults should
  be included in putParamset calls.

- **Added CodeQL workflow with Python 3.14**: Custom CodeQL analysis workflow
  using `setup-python-dependencies: false` and explicit Python 3.14 setup to
  avoid parse errors from new Python 3.14 syntax features.

# Version 2026.4.6 (2026-04-09)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added `determine_parameter` to `ValueOperationsProtocol`**: The client
  protocol interface now exposes `determine_parameter`, making it available
  through the protocol-based DI layer.

# Version 2026.4.5 (2026-04-09)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added `determine_parameter` support**: New `determine_parameter` method on
  `BackendOperationsProtocol`, `BaseBackend`, `CcuBackend`, and
  `InterfaceClient` that wraps the XML-RPC `determineParameter` call for
  auto-detecting parameter values on a channel.

# Version 2026.4.4 (2026-04-08)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added channel name to configurable device channel data**: The
  `ConfigurableDeviceChannel` dataclass now includes a `channel_name` field,
  exposing user-defined channel names in the configuration coordinator API for
  use in the configuration panel.

# Version 2026.4.3 (2026-04-08)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added channel name to device link and linkable channel data**: The
  `DeviceLink` dataclass now includes `sender_channel_name` and
  `receiver_channel_name` fields, and `LinkableChannel` includes `channel_name`.
  This exposes user-defined channel names in the link coordinator API for use in
  the configuration panel.

### Docs

- **Documented schedule editing permissions for non-admin users**: Added
  permissions sections to the Climate Schedule Card and Schedule Card
  documentation. Extended the Config Panel documentation with a new section
  explaining how to enable schedule editing for non-admin household members.

# Version 2026.4.2 (2026-04-07)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Added additional data points for HmIP-DLP (Door Lock Pro)**: Enabled
  additional entities from channels beyond the main lock (Ch12) and button lock
  (Ch0). New data points include door state (Ch3), permission state (Ch4-11),
  lock state reason (Ch12), auto relock state (Ch13), and sabotage sensors (Ch0).
  Added `LOCK_STATE_REASON`, `AUTO_RELOCK_STATE`, `PERMISSION_STATE`,
  `SABOTAGE_ACCELERATION`, `SABOTAGE_BATTERY`, `SABOTAGE_MAGNETIC_FIELD`, and
  `SABOTAGE_VERTICAL` to the `Parameter` enum. Added HmIP-DLP to
  `UN_IGNORE_PARAMETERS_BY_DEVICE` for `ERROR_JAMMED`.

- **Registered additional data points in multi-channel detection cache**: When
  `additional_data_points` activates a generic data point on a channel outside
  the custom data point's own channel group, the parameter is now registered in
  the `_address_parameter_cache` of `ParamsetDescriptionRegistry`. This ensures
  `is_in_multiple_channels()` returns correct results for parameters that appear
  on multiple channels via `additional_data_points`. Added
  `register_additional_parameter()` to `ParamsetDescriptionProviderProtocol`
  and `ParamsetDescriptionRegistry`.

- **Synthesize missing parameter name translations from value entries**: The CCU
  translation extraction script now derives parameter name translations from
  value-entry templates when no explicit parameter name entry exists in the
  stringtable. When all value entries for a parameter share the same leading
  template variable (e.g. `${stringTableAutoRelockState}: ${lblYes}`), that
  variable is resolved as the parameter name. This adds ~89 previously missing
  parameter translations, including `AUTO_RELOCK_STATE` for HmIP-DLP.

### Fixed

- **Fixed multi-channel postfix for data point names**: The channel postfix
  (`ch{no}`) is now applied consistently when a parameter appears in multiple
  channels, regardless of whether the channel name contains an address
  separator. Previously, the postfix was only added when the channel name
  matched the `address:channel_no` pattern, causing missing disambiguation for
  channels with custom names.

- **Fixed spurious optimistic rollbacks for CUxD/CCU-Jack devices**: Disabled
  optimistic updates for interfaces without RPC callback support (CUxD,
  CCU-Jack). These interfaces receive event confirmations via MQTT with
  unpredictable latency (often >30s for slow devices like FHT80b), causing the
  30-second rollback timer to fire before the confirmation arrives. This led to
  incorrect value reversions and cascading write loops. The value now updates
  only when the MQTT confirmation arrives, regardless of latency. (#3103)

# Version 2026.4.1 (2026-04-05)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed sysvar and device data points temporarily showing unknown after setting
  the same value**: When `send_variable()` or `send_value()` was called with a
  value identical to the already confirmed value, the unconfirmed value was not
  populated (remained `None`) while the unconfirmed timestamp was updated. This
  caused `_value` to return `None` (shown as "unknown" in Home Assistant) until
  the next polling cycle confirmed the value (~20-30 seconds). The issue was more
  likely to occur with rapid value changes or when setting to 0. Fixed by always
  populating `_unconfirmed_value` regardless of whether the value changed.
  Fixes #3090.

- **Fixed device schedules appearing empty for cover and dimmer devices**: The CCU
  reports `level_2` values slightly above 1.0 (e.g. 1.01) for some cover devices
  like HmIP-BROLL. The Pydantic validation on `SimpleScheduleEntry.level_2`
  (`le=1.0`) rejected these values, causing the entire schedule group to be
  silently skipped. Fixed by clamping `level_2` to `[0.0, 1.0]` in
  `convert_raw_group_to_simple_entry()`, consistent with the existing `level`
  clamping. Fixes #3092.

# Version 2026.4.0 (2026-04-03)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed forced-to-sensor data points not publishing events**: Data points with
  `force_to_sensor()` (LEVEL on HmIP-eTRV and HmIP-HEATING) were publishing
  `DataPointStateChangedEvent` and `DeviceRemovedEvent` with the internal
  `_unique_id` attribute instead of the `unique_id` property (which includes the
  `_sensor` suffix). This caused a key mismatch in the EventBus — subscribers
  registered with the property value never received events. Also fixed
  `cleanup_subscriptions()` using the wrong key, which caused orphaned
  subscriptions (memory leak). Regression introduced in #3081.

### Added

- **CLI tool documentation**: New `docs/developer/cli_tool.md` documents the
  `hmcli` command-line tool with all commands, interactive mode, JSON output,
  shell completion, and common debugging use cases.

- **Restore procedures**: Added restore section to `docs/user/features/backup.md`
  covering restore via Home Assistant and CCU WebUI, verification checklist,
  and failure recovery.

- **Consumer API documentation**: Expanded `docs/developer/consumer_api.md`
  with sections for SubscriptionGroup pattern, DataPoint registration
  (`register()`/`unregister()`), type-safe queries (`get_data_points_by_type()`),
  event tiers (public vs internal), and command throttling.

- **Contributor guide**: Added "Where to start" section to
  `docs/contributor/contributing.md` with contribution tiers by experience level.
  Added 3 missing lint scripts to `docs/contributor/dev-environment.md`
  (`lint_event_tiers.py`, `lint_delegated_property.py`, `lint_rega_scripts.py`).

- **Global abbreviations**: Added TLS and EEPROM to
  `docs/includes/abbreviations.md` for automatic tooltip expansion.

- **German documentation (i18n)**: Added complete German translations for all
  18 user-facing documentation pages (Phase 1 + Phase 2). Infrastructure uses
  `mkdocs-static-i18n` plugin with language switcher. German pages live under
  `docs/de/` with identical structure. Translation workflow managed by
  `script/translate_docs.py` (status checking, hash tracking, scaffolding).
  Terminology consistency enforced via `docs/de/glossary_terms.yml` (~80 terms).
  English remains the source language; German translations are produced locally
  via Claude Code. Existing URLs unchanged (EN at `/`, DE at `/de/`).

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md**: Updated version to 2026.4.0, replaced all subscription
  examples with EventBus pattern, added `lint_event_tiers.py` to scripts table,
  updated last-modified date.

- **README.md**: Fixed 4 code bugs in Quick Start example (wrong parameter
  names, missing `await`, incorrect property name).

### Improved

- **Instance name clarity**: Added concrete example to
  `docs/user/homeassistant_integration.md` explaining why unique instance names
  matter with multiple HA instances.

- **Callback concept**: Added explanation in integration docs of how CCU pushes
  events via XML-RPC callbacks and what breaks when the callback path fails.

- **Docker networking**: Expanded Docker section in `docs/faq.md` with
  step-by-step options (host networking vs manual callback_host) and commands
  to find Docker host IP.

- **Stale API references removed**: Updated 6 architecture and developer docs
  to replace removed `subscribe_to_data_point_updated`, `custom_id`, and
  `get_data_point_by_custom_id` references with current EventBus patterns.

# Version 2026.3.23 (2026-03-31)

## What's Changed

### Breaking

- **Unified subscription architecture**: DataPoint subscriptions now go through
  the EventBus instead of a separate mechanism. The following APIs have been
  removed:

  - `CallbackDataPoint.subscribe_to_data_point_updated(handler, custom_id)`
  - `CallbackDataPoint.subscribe_to_device_removed(handler)`
  - `CallbackDataPoint.subscribe_to_internal_data_point_updated(handler)`
  - `CallbackDataPoint.custom_id` property
  - `DataPointStateChangedEvent.custom_id` field
  - `CentralUnit.get_data_point_by_custom_id()`
  - `DeviceQueryFacade.get_data_point_by_custom_id()`

  Consumers now subscribe directly via `EventBus.subscribe(event_type=DataPointStateChangedEvent, event_key=dp.unique_id, handler=...)` and use `SubscriptionGroup` for lifecycle management.

- **DataPoint registration separated from subscription**: New `register()` /
  `unregister()` methods replace the implicit registration via
  `subscribe_to_data_point_updated(custom_id=...)`. The `is_registered`
  property is now a simple boolean flag.

### Added

- **Event tier enforcement**: Internal events structurally separated into
  `aiohomematic.central.events.internal`. Public `__all__` only exports public
  events. New lint script `script/lint_event_tiers.py` enforces that external
  consumers do not import internal events.

- **DeviceQueryFacade.get_data_points_by_type()**: Type-safe data point lookup
  filtering by concrete class, eliminating `cast()` in consumer code.

- **Public API surface documentation**: `docs/reference/api/public_api.md`
  defines stable import paths in three tiers for external consumers.

- **Session playback documentation**: `docs/contributor/testing/session_playback.md`
  documents the test session recording and playback infrastructure.

- **Coordinator responsibility matrix**: Added to `docs/architecture.md` with
  per-coordinator summaries and interaction matrix.

### Changed

- **Event module structure**: Internal event classes moved from `bus.py` to
  `internal.py`. All internal consumers import from
  `aiohomematic.central.events.internal` directly.

- **publish_data_point_updated_event()**: Now publishes a single event instead
  of N events (one per registered custom_id). Signature simplified: `data_point`
  and `custom_id` parameters removed.

# Version 2026.3.22 (2026-03-31)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fixed acknowledge for alarm messages**: `acknowledge_message.fn` now distinguishes
  between service messages (`ID_SERVICES`) and alarm messages. Service messages still
  require `OPERATION_WRITE` on the trigger datapoint, while alarm messages are always
  acknowledged — matching the CCU WebUI behavior (`alarmMessages.htm`).

- **Fixed false channel identification for hub data points**: `Device.identify_channel`
  used plain substring matching (`str(ise_id) in text`) for ISE ID lookups, causing
  false positives when short numeric IDs (e.g. `0`, `10`) appeared as suffixes in
  system variable names like `SV_HKV_10`. This could lead to incorrect name generation
  and missing entities in Home Assistant. The method now uses word-boundary matching,
  requiring the ID to be delimited by non-word characters.

### Changed

- **Renamed `rega_id` to `ise_id`**: Aligned internal naming with official Homematic
  terminology. The CCU-internal object identifier is called `ise_id` (not `rega_id`)
  in the Homematic ecosystem. This is a breaking API change affecting
  `Device.ise_id`, `Channel.ise_id`, and client methods like `get_ise_id_by_address`,
  `rename_device(ise_id=...)`, `rename_channel(ise_id=...)`, `has_program_ids(ise_id=...)`.

# Version 2026.3.21 (2026-03-30)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Quittable flag based on trigger datapoint**: `get_service_messages.fn` now
  checks `OPERATION_WRITE` on the trigger datapoint instead of the alarm object,
  matching the CCU WebUI behavior (`serviceMessages.htm`).

- **Acknowledge only writable messages**: `acknowledge_message.fn` now refuses to
  acknowledge messages whose trigger datapoint lacks the `OPERATION_WRITE` bit,
  returning an error instead of silently acknowledging non-quittable messages.

### Changed

- **Removed auto-enable of alarm/service SysVars**: The system variables
  `${sysVarAlarmMessages}` (ID 40) and `${sysVarServiceMessages}` (ID 41) are no
  longer force-enabled and renamed. These are fully superseded by the dedicated
  `HmAlarmMessagesSensor` and `HmServiceMessagesSensor` hub data points.

- **Exposed message DPs on HubCoordinator**: `alarm_messages_dp` and
  `service_messages_dp` are now accessible via `HubCoordinator` as
  `DelegatedProperty` for direct access from downstream consumers.

# Version 2026.3.20 (2026-03-29)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Message enrichment in aiohomematic**: `ServiceMessageData` and
  `AlarmMessageData` now include pre-resolved fields (`message_code`,
  `display_name`, `msg_type_name`) so downstream consumers no longer need to
  extract parameter names from raw CCU message formats or map numeric types to
  text. Translations are provided via the existing i18n system (en/de).

- **ServiceMessageType enum extended**: Added `ALARM` (3), `UPDATE_PENDING` (4),
  and `COMMUNICATION` (5) to cover all CCU service message types.

- **Additional information for message sensors**: `HmAlarmMessagesSensor` and
  `HmServiceMessagesSensor` now expose each message as an individual extra state
  attribute (`alarm_1`, `alarm_2`, ... / `message_1`, `message_2`, ...) with
  human-readable display names, making them directly accessible in HA templates.

- **Dynamic i18n key detection**: `check_i18n_catalogs.py` now recognizes
  f-string prefixes in `i18n.tr()` calls, preventing false unused-key warnings
  for dynamically constructed translation keys.

### Fixed

- **DST-safe callback alive and connection checks**: Replaced `datetime.now()`
  with `time.monotonic()` for all duration calculations in `is_callback_alive()`,
  `is_connected()`, and `ConnectionHealth` scoring. Wall-clock time jumps during
  DST transitions (or NTP corrections) caused false callback timeout detections
  (e.g. 3602s instead of 2s after a spring-forward). Monotonic timestamps are
  immune to clock adjustments. The `LastEventTrackerProtocol` gains a new
  `get_last_event_monotonic_for_interface()` method.

- **Alarm messages not returned**: Fixed ReGa script `get_alarm_messages.fn`
  not returning active alarm messages. The script required a resolvable trigger
  data point (`AlTriggerDP`), but system alarms (e.g. WatchDog) use the
  sentinel value 65535 which has no backing object. Trigger information is now
  optional. Also replaced the `asOncoming` constant with numeric `1` for
  reliability across CCU firmware versions.

# Version 2026.3.19 (2026-03-28)

## What's Changed

### Added

#### Cross-Project Platform Improvements

- **DataPointType enum**: New `DataPointType` StrEnum providing a canonical
  data point type (SENSOR, SWITCH, CLIMATE, COVER, LIGHT, LOCK, etc.) for
  downstream consumers. Accessible via `data_point.data_point_type` property
  on all data point types. Eliminates isinstance checks and custom mapping
  logic in bridges and integrations.

- **CentralUnit async context manager**: `CentralUnit` now supports `async with`
  for automatic `start()`/`stop()` lifecycle management, preventing resource leaks.

- **EventBus subscription groups**: New `SubscriptionGroup` class and
  `event_bus.create_subscription_group(name)` factory method for collective
  subscription lifecycle management. Replaces error-prone manual unsubscribe
  callback tracking with `group.subscribe()` / `group.unsubscribe_all()`.

- **Device name in events**: `DeviceTriggerEvent`, `DeviceLifecycleEvent`,
  `OptimisticRollbackEvent`, and `DataPointStateChangedEvent` now carry
  human-readable device names (`device_name` / `device_names` fields),
  eliminating the need for downstream consumers to perform separate device
  registry lookups.

- **State transition callback API**: New `central.on_state_transition()` method
  for registering handlers on specific `CentralState` transitions (e.g.,
  DEGRADED → RUNNING). Supports wildcard `from_state=None` for any-source
  transitions.

- **Extended query facade**: `get_data_points()` now accepts a `data_point_type`
  filter parameter. New `get_devices()` method with `interface` and `available`
  filters for device-level queries. New `get_schedule_capable_devices()` method
  returning `ScheduleInfo` objects for devices with week profile support.

#### OpenCCU API Extensions

- **System variable creation**: New methods `create_system_variable_bool()`,
  `create_system_variable_float()`, and `create_system_variable_enum()` for
  creating system variables on the CCU backend. Exposed through JSON-RPC client,
  backend protocol, CcuBackend, InterfaceClient, and HubCoordinator.

- **Link info read/write**: New methods `get_link_info()` and `set_link_info()`
  for reading and writing link metadata (name, description) between paired
  device channels. Exposed through JSON-RPC client, backend protocol,
  CcuBackend, InterfaceClient, and LinkCoordinator.

- **Service message suppression**: New methods `get_suppressed_service_messages()`
  and `suppress_service_message()` for suppressing or unsuppressing service
  messages per channel. Exposed through JSON-RPC client, backend protocol,
  CcuBackend, InterfaceClient, and HubCoordinator.

#### Parameter Metadata

- **Conditional visibility metadata**: `SenderTypeMetadata` now supports
  `conditional_visibility` (rules for showing/hiding parameters based on
  trigger values), `parameter_groups` (semantic grouping of related parameters),
  and `cross_validation_rule_ids` (references to applicable cross-parameter
  validation rules). Data is parsed from the easymode archive when available.

# Version 2026.3.18 (2026-03-27)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **SysvarDpSwitch turn_on/turn_off**: Added `turn_on()` and `turn_off()` methods
  to `SysvarDpSwitch`, enabling direct use as a HA `SwitchEntity`. Previously only
  the generic `send_variable(value=...)` was available. The methods use optimistic
  state updates via `send_variable`.

# Version 2026.3.17 (2026-03-25)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Service messages hub sensor**: New `HmServiceMessagesSensor` exposes active CCU
  service messages (from `ID_SERVICES`) as a hub sensor in Home Assistant. The sensor
  value is the count of active messages; full message details are available via the
  `messages` attribute.

- **Alarm messages hub sensor**: New `HmAlarmMessagesSensor` exposes active CCU alarm
  messages (from `ID_SYSTEM_VARIABLES`) as a hub sensor. These are user-created system
  alarms shown in the CCU WebUI under "Alarmmeldungen" — previously not available in
  aiohomematic at all.

- **Extended service message data**: `ServiceMessageData` now includes `last_timestamp`,
  `counter`, `rooms` (tuple), `functions` (tuple), and `quittable` flag, matching the
  data shown in the CCU WebUI. Inactive channels are filtered out.

- **Alarm message data**: New `AlarmMessageData` dataclass with `alarm_id`, `name`,
  `description`, `device_name`, `timestamp`, `last_timestamp`, `counter`, `last_trigger`,
  and `rooms`.

- **New ReGa script**: `get_alarm_messages.fn` reads alarm messages from
  `ID_SYSTEM_VARIABLES`, filtered for active `ALARMDP` objects.

- **New device HmIP-DLP**: Added support for the IP Door Lock Pro with lock
  control (channel 12) and button lock (channel 0). Includes battery data
  (4× AA).

- **Backend capability**: `alarm_messages` flag added to `BackendCapabilities`
  (enabled for CCU backend only).

- **Acknowledge messages**: New `acknowledge_message()` method on `AioJsonRpcAioHttpClient`
  allows quitting (receipting) service messages and alarm messages by their ReGa ID.
  Uses new `acknowledge_message.fn` ReGa script with `AlReceipt()` for both
  `ID_SERVICES` and `ALARMDP` objects.

### Fixed

- **get_alarm_messages.fn**: Fixed ReGa parse error caused by non-existent
  `LastTriggerMessage()` method. Replaced with trigger data point name via
  `AlTriggerDP()`. Added `AlTriggerDP() > 0` filter to exclude system counting
  variables (`${sysVarAlarmMessages}`, `${sysVarPresence}`) and user-created
  alarm-type sysvars without device triggers. Switched from compound `&&`
  conditions to nested `if` statements to prevent ReGa error propagation.

- **get_alarm_messages.fn / get_service_messages.fn**: Fixed `device_name`,
  `rooms`, and `functions` fields being empty or containing ReGa object IDs
  instead of actual names. Root cause: `oTrigger.Channel()` returns the
  channel ID (integer), not the object — added `dom.GetObject(iChnId)` to
  resolve the channel object before accessing `Name()`, `ChnRoom()`, and
  `ChnFunction()`.

- **get_service_messages.fn**: Removed `ChnInactive()` check that caused
  runtime errors on some channels, breaking the entire iteration and producing
  malformed JSON output (`[,,,]`).

# Version 2026.3.16 (2026-03-24)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Consolidate CCU extracted data into gzip archives**: Restructured the storage
  of CCU-sourced data from individual JSON files to gzip-compressed archives,
  reducing package size from ~11 MB to ~516 KB (95% reduction).

  - New directory `aiohomematic/ccu_data/` replaces the previous scattered layout:
    - `easymode_extract.json.gz` — all easymode metadata (was 65 files + 2 in
      `easymode_extract/`, 10 MB → 140 KB)
    - `translation_extract.json.gz` — all extracted CCU translations (was 11 files
      in `translations/ccu_extract/`, 636 KB → 125 KB)
    - `translation_custom/` — hand-maintained translation overrides (unchanged,
      editable JSON files)
  - Updated `easymode_data.py` and `ccu_translations.py` loaders to decompress
    from `.json.gz` archives via `gzip.decompress()` + `pkgutil.get_data()`
  - Updated extraction scripts (`extract_ccu_easymodes.py`,
    `extract_ccu_translations.py`) to output gzip archives directly
  - Removed `aiohomematic/easymode_extract/`, `translations/ccu_extract/`, and
    `translations/ccu_custom/` directories

# Version 2026.3.14 (2026-03-24)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Add CCU easymode metadata extraction**: New script
  `script/extract_ccu_easymodes.py` parses TCL easymode configuration files from
  the CCU WebUI and extracts structured metadata for 65 channel types, including
  easymode profiles, subsets, parameter ordering, and option preset references.
  Supports dual-source loading from local OCCU checkout and/or remote CCU instance.

- **Add easymode data loader API**: New module `aiohomematic/easymode_data.py`
  provides thread-safe, lazily loaded access to extracted easymode metadata
  (channel metadata, option presets, cross-validation rules) via `pkgutil.get_data()`.

- **Add 46 option preset definitions**: Extracted preset sets (BLIND_LEVEL, DELAY,
  LENGTH_OF_STAY, DIM_ONLEVEL, RAMPTIME, LOGIC_COMBINATION, etc.) from
  `options.tcl` for use in configuration UI dropdowns.

- **Add cross-parameter validation**: New `validate_cross_parameters()` function
  in `parameter_tools.py` checks constraints between related parameters (e.g.
  DIM_MAX_LEVEL >= DIM_MIN_LEVEL, COND_VALUE_HI >= COND_VALUE_LO). Integrated
  into `ConfigurationCoordinator.put_paramset()` to validate before RPC call.

- **Include easymode extract data in package**: Updated `pyproject.toml` to
  include `easymode_extract/*.json` and `easymode_extract/channel_metadata/*.json`
  in the distributed package.

- **Extract easymode TCL inline option value translations**: New
  `parse_easymode_tcl_option_values()` in `script/extract_ccu_translations.py`
  extracts `param=index` → translated label mappings from `set options(N)`
  patterns inside easymode TCL files, adding ~320 new parameter value
  translations per locale (EN/DE) for parameters like `acoustic_alarm_signal`,
  `acoustic_alarm_timing`, `optical_alarm_signal`, and many more.

- **Add `use_fallback` parameter to `get_parameter_value_translation()`**: New
  optional `use_fallback` flag (default `True`) allows callers to skip the
  generic value-only fallback and restrict lookups to parameter-specific
  translations only.

# Version 2026.3.13 (2026-03-22)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Extract 134 additional parameter translations from CCU firmware**: Expanded
  the CCU translation extraction script to scan all easymode TCL files (not just
  `*_master.tcl`), resolving parameter-to-template-variable mappings from
  `hmipChannelConfigDialogs.tcl` and other HmIP configuration dialogs. Also
  broadened the template variable regex to match all camelCase variables (not
  just `stringTable*`/`lbl*` prefixes). PNAME labels now take priority over
  easymode TCL labels to preserve official localization quality.

### Added

- **Add 85 custom parameter translations**: Added German and English labels for
  parameters that have help text in the CCU firmware but no label (e.g.
  `blocking_period`, `door_lock_hold_time`, `sensor_sensitivity_rain`,
  `mounting_orientation`, ESI OBIS codes, soil moisture settings, and many more
  HmIP MASTER parameters).

# Version 2026.3.12 (2026-03-22)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Skip duplicate optimistic sends for identical values**: When an automation
  triggers `switch.turn_on` twice in rapid succession (~100ms), the second send
  is now skipped if an optimistic value with the same target is already pending.
  Previously, the optimistic tracker incremented `pending_sends` to 2 while the
  CCU only confirmed once, causing a spurious rollback after 30s that set the
  switch to OFF despite the device being physically ON (#3049).

### Improved

- **Hide `BOOTED` parameter by default**: Added `BOOTED` to the default hidden
  parameters list in visibility rules.

# Version 2026.3.11 (2026-03-21)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Add `resolve_channel_type` for HmIP translation lookups**: New function
  that resolves the effective channel type for translation lookups by appending
  `_HMIP` when HmIP-specific translations exist, matching the CCU WebUI
  behavior where HmIP devices may have different parameter semantics.

# Version 2026.3.10 (2026-03-19)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Include hidden and device-level channels with MASTER paramset in
  configuration**: Device-level entries, internal channels, and invisible
  channels were previously excluded from `get_configurable_channels()`. They are
  now included when they have a MASTER paramset (restricted to MASTER only),
  allowing configuration of device-wide settings that live on these channels.
- **Show read-only MASTER parameters in device configuration**: The MASTER
  paramset filter in `get_configurable_devices()` previously required parameters
  to be writable. It now includes all visible, non-internal parameters regardless
  of write access, so read-only configuration values are also displayed.

# Version 2026.3.9 (2026-03-19)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Skip optimistic updates for action data points**: Action data points
  (ACTION, ACTION_NUMBER, ACTION_SELECT, BUTTON) and parameters without event
  support never receive CCU event confirmations. The optimistic update timer
  would always expire after 30 seconds, causing spurious OPTIMISTIC_ROLLBACK
  timeout warnings in the log. This was particularly visible with the HmIP-MP3P
  LED channel (Repetitions, Ramp Time, Duration parameters).

### Improved

- **TLS: Use certifi CA bundle when available**: The TLS context now loads the
  `certifi` CA bundle in addition to the system default verify paths when the
  `certifi` package is installed. This ensures trusted certificates work
  out-of-the-box in environments like Home Assistant that ship `certifi` but may
  not have a complete system trust store.

# Version 2026.3.8 (2026-03-13)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Connection recovery heartbeat not starting after startup failure**: The
  `_on_central_state_changed` handler compared the trigger string with exact
  match (`== "no clients connected"`), but `central_unit.py` emits
  `"no clients connected (start() completed)"`. Changed to `startswith` for
  robust matching. Without this fix, the heartbeat timer never started after
  a startup failure (e.g., CCU rebooting after firmware update), leaving the
  central stuck in `FAILED` state with no automatic retry.

# Version 2026.3.7 (2026-03-11)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **`PayloadProtocol`**: New protocol interface guaranteeing `config_payload`,
  `info_payload`, and `state_payload` properties. Added to `DeviceProtocol`,
  `ChannelProtocol`, `BaseDataPointProtocol`, `GenericHubDataPointProtocol`,
  and `CentralProtocol`. Downstream consumers can now depend on the payload API
  through protocol interfaces. Defined in `_payload_protocol.py` (minimal module
  to avoid circular imports, following the `_log_context_protocol.py` pattern).
  `PayloadMixin` now explicitly inherits from `PayloadProtocol`.

# Version 2026.3.6 (2026-03-11)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Property `alt_name` support**: All property decorators (`config_property`,
  `state_property`, `info_property`, `hm_property`) and `DelegatedProperty` now
  accept an optional `alt_name` parameter. When `use_alt_names=True` is passed
  to `get_hm_property_by_kind()`, the alternative name is used as dict key
  instead of the property name. This enables payload keys to differ from
  internal property names.
- `PayloadMixin` (`config_payload`, `state_payload`, `info_payload`) now uses
  `use_alt_names=True` by default, so properties with `alt_name` automatically
  use the alternative key in payloads. Log context remains unaffected and
  continues to use the original property name.
- **Exact contract tests for payload key stability**: Rewrote property decorator
  contract tests to use exact set equality via `get_hm_property_by_kind()`
  instead of subset checks. Tests now detect property additions, removals, Kind
  reclassifications, and `alt_name` changes for `Device`, Climate, and generic
  `DataPoint` classes. Added INFO key verification for generic data points.

### Changed

- **Capabilities use `config_property(cached=True)`**: Reclassified
  `capabilities` properties in Climate, Cover, Garage, Light, Lock, and Siren
  from `@info_property(cached=True)` to `@config_property(cached=True)`.
  Capabilities describe immutable device features determined at init, which
  aligns with `Kind.CONFIG` semantics.
- **Device payload alt_names**: Added `alt_name` mappings to `Device` properties
  for Home Assistant-aligned payload keys: `address` → `serial_number`,
  `model_description` → `model_id`, `firmware` → `sw_version`,
  `identifier` → `identifiers`, `room` → `suggested_area`.
- **Climate payload alt_names**: Added `alt_name` mappings to climate properties:
  `activity` → `action`, `mode` → `hvac_mode`, `modes` → `hvac_modes`,
  `profile` → `preset_mode`, `profiles` → `preset_modes`.

# Version 2026.3.5 (2026-03-10)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Data point metadata**: Introduced `Quantity` and `ValueBehavior` enums in
  `const.py` and a new `data_point_metadata.py` module that maps Homematic
  parameters to their semantic quantity (e.g., temperature, humidity, energy)
  and value behavior (instantaneous, cumulative, monotonic). The `quantity` and
  `value_behavior` properties are now available on `BaseParameterDataPoint`.
- **Cover capabilities**: Introduced `CoverCapabilities` dataclass with static
  capability flags (`position`, `tilt`, `stop`, `vent`) for cover entities,
  consistent with the existing capabilities pattern used by Light, Climate, Lock,
  and Siren. Predefined capability sets: `COVER_CAPABILITIES`,
  `BLIND_CAPABILITIES`, `GARAGE_CAPABILITIES`. This replaces the need for
  `isinstance()` checks to determine cover features.
- **Cover device documentation**: Added detailed documentation for cover device
  types, capabilities, and garage door specifics including discrete state
  mapping and position slider behavior.

### Changed

- **Capabilities use `info_property(cached=True)`**: Replaced manual
  `getattr`/`object.__setattr__` caching pattern in `capabilities` properties
  across Climate, Light, Lock, and Siren with the declarative
  `@info_property(cached=True)` decorator. The `_capabilities` slot has been
  renamed to `_cached_capabilities` accordingly.
- **Property decorator improvements**: `config_property` and `info_property`
  now support a `cached=True` parameter for lazy-computed immutable values.
  Dataclass instances in log context are automatically converted to dicts.
- **Light property categorization**: Reclassified `brightness_pct`,
  `group_brightness`, `group_brightness_pct`, and other light properties from
  plain `@property` to `@state_property` for proper state tracking.
- **Climate temperature bounds**: `min_temp` and `max_temp` in
  `BaseCustomDpClimate` changed from `@state_property` to `@config_property`
  since temperature bounds are configuration values, not runtime state.
- **DelegatedProperty kind annotations**: Added `Kind.CONFIG`/`Kind.STATE`
  annotations to `ClimateWeekProfile.max_temp`/`min_temp` and
  `CustomDpTextDisplay.burst_limit_warning`.

# Version 2026.3.4 (2026-03-08)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Health tracker central state sync**: Added `sync_central_state()` to
  `HealthTracker` to synchronize the cached central state after
  `_evaluate_central_state()` completes. Previously, the `CentralHealth` object
  could hold a stale central state after start or system status events that did
  not trigger a client health update.

# Version 2026.3.3 (2026-03-07)

## What's Changed

### Security

- **ReGa script injection prevention**: Added `_escape_rega_string()` to escape
  backslashes and double quotes before interpolating values into ReGa script
  templates, preventing script injection via crafted system variable names,
  device addresses, or program IDs.
- **Device address validation**: `accept_device_in_inbox()` now validates the
  device address format before passing it to ReGa script substitution.
- **Password field protection**: `CentralConfig.password` now uses
  `Field(repr=False, exclude=True)` to prevent accidental exposure via
  `repr()`, `str()`, or `model_dump()`.
- **Authorization header sanitization**: Added pattern for `Authorization: Basic`
  headers to `_SENSITIVE_PATTERNS` in error message sanitization.
- **TLS disabled warning**: JSON-RPC client now logs an info message when TLS is
  disabled, warning that credentials are transmitted in plain text.
- **Unknown interface_id logging**: RPC callback server now logs a warning when
  receiving events for an unregistered interface_id.
- **ReGa script path traversal prevention**: `_get_script()` and `_post_script()`
  now require `RegaScript` enum instead of arbitrary strings, preventing path
  traversal attacks via crafted script names.
- **Firmware URL scheme validation**: `download_firmware()` now rejects URLs with
  non-HTTP(S) schemes, preventing the CCU from connecting to arbitrary protocols.
- **Restrictive temp file permissions**: Storage temp files are now created with
  `0o600` permissions before being atomically replaced, preventing other users
  from reading cached data.
- **Path traversal protection in `delete_file()`**: File paths resolved via glob
  are now validated to stay within the target directory using `realpath()` checks.
- **Documented `DEFAULT_VERIFY_TLS=False`**: Added comment explaining that TLS
  verification is disabled by default due to self-signed certificates in typical
  home automation setups.
- **RPC background task limit**: The XML-RPC callback server now enforces a
  maximum of 1000 concurrent background tasks (`MAX_RPC_BACKGROUND_TASKS`).
  Excess tasks are dropped with a warning, preventing memory exhaustion from
  event floods.
- **Cryptographic RNG for address anonymization**: Replaced `random.randint()`
  and `random.shuffle()` with `secrets.randbelow()` and
  `secrets.SystemRandom().shuffle()` for device address anonymization in exports
  and session recordings.
- **Restrictive directory permissions**: `os.makedirs()` calls in storage,
  device export, and file operations now use `mode=0o700`, ensuring only the
  owner can access storage directories.

### Performance

- **EventBus pre-sorted handlers**: Handlers are now inserted in priority order
  via `bisect.insort` during subscription, eliminating `sorted()` on every
  event publish.
- **Parallel device finalization**: `finalize_init()` for new devices now runs
  concurrently via `asyncio.gather()`, reducing startup time.
- **Parallel client refresh**: Polled interface data refreshes now run
  concurrently instead of sequentially.
- **Optimized custom_id lookup**: `get_data_point_by_custom_id()` now iterates
  devices directly instead of materializing a full tuple first.
- **Parallel interface operations**: Client creation (secondary), initialization,
  de-initialization, device discovery (`start_direct`), and firmware refresh now
  run concurrently across interfaces via `asyncio.gather()`, while operations
  within a single interface remain serial (CCU limitation).
- **Parallel async checks**: `remove_central_link()` now runs `_has_central_link()`
  and `_has_program_ids()` concurrently instead of sequentially.
- **Pre-compiled description marker regex**: Program and system variable description
  marker removal now uses a single pre-compiled regex pattern instead of iterating
  over all `DescriptionMarker` enum values with `str.replace()`.
- **`weakref.finalize` for subscription cleanup**: `CustomDataPoint`,
  `CalculatedDataPoint`, `CombinedDataPoint`, and `ClimateWeekProfileDataPoint`
  now use `weakref.finalize()` instead of `__del__()` for subscription cleanup,
  ensuring reliable garbage collection even with circular references.
- **`slots=True` for dataclasses**: `ValidationResult` and `ParamsetChange`
  dataclasses now use `slots=True` to reduce per-instance memory overhead.
- **Optimized `is_in_multi_channel_group()`**: Replaced list comprehension with
  `sum()` generator and early `None` return.

# Version 2026.3.2 (2026-03-06)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Python 3.14 minimum**: Dropped Python 3.13 support. Python 3.14 is now the
  minimum required version. All tool configurations (ruff, mypy, pylint) updated
  to target Python 3.14.
-

# Version 2026.3.1 (2026-03-05)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **DpActionNumber data points**: New `DpActionFloat` and `DpActionInteger` generic
  data point types for write-only FLOAT/INTEGER parameters. These provide number
  entities in Home Assistant (with MIN/MAX validation) while remaining write-only
  at the protocol level. Previously, all write-only numeric parameters were mapped
  to `DpAction` (no HA entity). The resolver now maps write-only FLOAT to
  `DpActionFloat` and write-only INTEGER to `DpActionInteger`.
- **DpActionBoolean and DpActionString data points**: New `DpActionBoolean` and
  `DpActionString` generic data point types for write-only BOOL/STRING parameters.
  These complete the DpAction hierarchy so that every CCU write-only parameter type
  has a type-safe handler. Previously, write-only BOOL and STRING parameters fell
  through to the generic `DpAction` fallback with `Any` value type. `DpAction` now
  only handles `TYPE=ACTION` parameters (triggers without type information).
- **Type-correct custom data point fields**: Replaced `DpAction` with specific types
  in custom data points where pydevccu paramset data shows a concrete TYPE:
  `MANU_MODE` (TYPE=FLOAT) → `DpActionFloat`, `CONTROL_MODE` on HmIP (TYPE=INTEGER)
  → `DpActionInteger`, `DISPLAY_DATA_COMMIT` (TYPE=BOOL) → `DpActionBoolean`,
  `DISPLAY_DATA_STRING`/`COMBINED_PARAMETER`/`LEVEL_COMBINED` (TYPE=STRING)
  → `DpActionString`. `DpAction` remains only for genuine TYPE=ACTION parameters
  (`AUTO_MODE`, `BOOST_MODE`, `COMFORT_MODE`, `LOWERING_MODE`, `STOP`, `OPEN`).

### Refactored

- **CombinedDataPoint for timer value+unit pairs**: Introduced `CombinedDataPoint`
  base class and `CombinedDpTimerAction` concrete implementation in
  `aiohomematic/model/combined/`. This new data point type combines multiple
  underlying data points (e.g., timer value + unit) into a single writable entity
  with automatic unit conversion (seconds to S/M/H). Replaced the ephemeral
  `TimerField`/`TimerAccessor` pattern with the `CombinedTimerField` descriptor,
  which creates persistent `CombinedDpTimerAction` instances during custom data
  point initialization. For the IP Siren (HmIP-ASIR), the duration combined data
  point is exposed as a visible HA number entity (max=58,834,800 seconds) with
  automatic unit conversion, replacing the raw `DURATION_VALUE` number entity that
  had no unit context. Applied across all custom data points with timer parameters:
  lights, sirens, switches, and valves. Also removed `TimerUnitMixin`,
  `OnOffActionMixin`, `TimerAccessor`, and `TimerField`.
- **CombinedDpHsColor for hue+saturation pairs**: New `CombinedDpHsColor` combined
  data point that encapsulates HUE + SATURATION into a single `tuple[float, float]`
  value with automatic saturation scaling (CCU 0.0–1.0 ↔ HA 0.0–100.0). Added
  `CombinedHsColorField` descriptor and generalized the combined field detection
  from timer-specific (`COMBINED_TIMER_FIELD_MARKER`) to generic
  (`COMBINED_FIELD_MARKER` + `CombinedFieldProtocol`). Simplified
  `CustomDpIpRGBWLight` and `CustomDpIpDrgDaliLight` by replacing identical
  boilerplate `hs_color` property and `turn_on()` conversion logic with delegation
  to the combined data point. Removed `ParamType` bound from `CombinedDataPoint`
  generic parameter to support non-`ParamType` value types.
- **Unified field visibility in profile configs**: Merged 6 field dictionaries
  (3 pairs of hidden/visible) in `ChannelGroupConfig` into 3 dictionaries where
  each entry carries its own visibility via `hidden()`/`visible()` helper functions.
  `fields`, `channel_fields`, and `fixed_channel_fields` now accept `FieldValue`
  (either bare `Parameter` for default behavior, `hidden(Parameter.X)` for NO_CREATE,
  or `visible(Parameter.X)` for CDP_VISIBLE). Removed `visible_fields`,
  `visible_channel_fields`, and `visible_fixed_channel_fields` from both
  `ChannelGroupConfig` and `RebasedChannelGroupConfig`. Updated `_init_data_points()`
  and helper methods to use `resolve_field_value()` for per-entry visibility extraction.
  Removed dead `ProfileKey.VISIBLE_FIELDS`, `ProfileKey.VISIBLE_REPEATABLE_FIELDS`,
  and `ProfileKey.REPEATABLE_FIELDS` enum members.

### Fixed

- **Scheduler busy-loop at 100% CPU during connection issues**: When
  `has_connection_issue` was True, the scheduler entered a busy-loop because skipped
  jobs (all except `_check_connection`) never advanced their `next_run`, causing the
  sleep calculation to compute `delay = 0.0`. The sleep calculation now only considers
  jobs eligible to run in the current state, and skipped jobs advance their schedule
  to prevent a burst of simultaneous execution on recovery.

---

# Version 2026.3.0 (2026-03-01)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Device link encoding**: Fix garbled UTF-8 characters in device link names
  and descriptions retrieved via XML-RPC. The CCU stores user-defined strings as
  UTF-8 but the XML-RPC transport decodes them as ISO-8859-1, causing multi-byte
  characters to be misinterpreted (e.g. `ü` → `Ã¼`). New `fix_xml_rpc_encoding`
  utility in `support.text_utils` reverses the double-encoding.

---

# Version 2026.2.32 (2026-02-28)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Non-climate schedule: allow empty target channels**: Schedules without
  explicit target channels were incorrectly filtered as inactive because
  `is_schedule_active()` required both weekdays and target channels. The CCU
  handles default channel assignment when no explicit channels are configured, so
  the activity check now only requires at least one weekday. The
  `SimpleScheduleEntry.target_channels` field default was changed from
  `min_length=1` to `default_factory=list` and the fallback in
  `convert_raw_group_to_simple_entry()` now returns an empty list instead of
  `["1_1"]`.

# Version 2026.2.31 (2026-02-27)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Install mode**: Use interface-specific client instead of primary client for
  install mode buttons. Previously, activating install mode for one interface
  (e.g. HmIP-RF) could incorrectly target another interface (e.g. BidCos-RF).
  (#2990)

---

# Version 2026.2.30 (2026-02-27)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Device icons**: Extract device model → icon filename mapping from CCU's
  `DEVDB.tcl` (525 entries). New `get_device_icon()` in `ccu_translations` and
  `icon` property on `Device` / `DeviceIdentityProtocol` expose the filename
  relative to `img/devices/250/` for downstream consumers (e.g. Home Assistant).
- **Profile-specific parameter translations**: Extract ~550 additional parameter
  translations from CCU easymode profile localization files (e.g. `COLOR_TEMP`,
  `MAX_COLOR_TEMP`, `SWITCH_DIRECTION`), merged with lowest priority into the
  existing `parameters_{locale}.json` output.

---

# Version 2026.2.29 (2026-02-27)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Parameter help texts**: Extract and expose Markdown-formatted help texts for
  ~165 MASTER paramset parameters (e.g. `BUTTON_LOCK`, `TEMPERATURE_OFFSET`,
  `VALVE_OFFSET`) from the CCU WebUI. The HTML content is converted to Markdown,
  template variables are resolved, and the result is available via
  `get_parameter_help()` in `ccu_translations` and as a `description` property
  on `BaseParameterDataPoint`.

---

# Version 2026.2.28 (2026-02-27)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix spurious optimistic update rollbacks**: `apply_optimistic_value()` was
  called before the `is_state_change()` check in the direct send path. When
  sending a value identical to the current state (e.g. turning off an already-off
  switch), the optimistic timer started but no RPC was sent to the CCU, making
  confirmation impossible. After 30 seconds the timer fired a spurious rollback
  with warning logs and `OptimisticRollbackEvent`. The state change check now
  runs first so optimistic tracking is only activated when an RPC call actually
  occurs.

---

# Version 2026.2.27 (2026-02-26)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix channel-specific translation lookup**: The `channel_type` parameter in
  `get_parameter_translation()` and `get_parameter_value_translation()` was not
  lowercased before lookup, while all stored keys are lowercase. This caused
  channel-specific translations (e.g. `maintenance|low_bat` → "Batterie") to
  never match when the channel type came from device descriptions in uppercase
  (e.g. `MAINTENANCE`). Both functions now normalize `channel_type` to lowercase.

### Docs

- **Document Week Profile sensor value**: Added explanation of the Week Profile
  sensor's numeric value to the user documentation, describing how the count of
  active schedule entries is computed for climate and non-climate devices.

---

# Version 2026.2.26 (2026-02-26)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Add option value translations from options.tcl**: The extraction script now
  parses `options.tcl` to resolve translated labels for MASTER paramset dropdown
  parameters. This adds ~65 new entries per locale to `parameter_values_*.json`,
  covering `POWERUP_JUMPTARGET`, `LOGIC_COMBINATION`, `FLOOR_HEATING_MODE`,
  `HEATING_MODE_SELECTION`, `MIOB_DIN_CONFIG`, `DALI_EFFECTS`, and more.
  Parameters that previously showed raw VALUE_LIST values (e.g. `ON_DELAY`,
  `LOGIC_OR`) now display human-readable labels in the UI.

---

# Version 2026.2.25 (2026-02-23)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Use JSON-RPC for HmIP-RF install mode**: The Java-based HMIPServer does
  not support the XML-RPC `setInstallMode` method — it throws
  `IllegalArgumentException: argument type mismatch` and returns an empty
  response. Install mode for HmIP-RF now uses the dedicated JSON-RPC methods
  `Interface.setInstallModeHMIP` and `Interface.getInstallMode` instead.
  BidCos-RF continues to use XML-RPC `setInstallMode` as before.
- **Fix BidCos-RF install mode with device address filter**: The XML-RPC call
  for signature (3) `setInstallMode(Boolean, Integer, String)` incorrectly
  sent 4 arguments `(on, time, mode, address)` instead of the documented 3
  arguments `(on, time, address)`.
- **Improve empty XML-RPC response handling**: Empty HTTP responses from the
  CCU (e.g. caused by server-side exceptions) are now caught as `ExpatError`
  with a specific warning log and raised as `ClientException`, instead of
  falling through to the generic exception handler.
- **Fix HmIP-HDM2 cover showing "unknown" state**: Devices without tilt support
  (e.g. HmIP-HDM2 in plissee mode) sent `LEVEL_2_STATUS = INVALID` from the
  CCU, which poisoned the cover entity's `is_status_valid` check and caused
  Home Assistant to show "unknown" state despite position control working.
  `CustomDpBlind` now excludes `LEVEL_2` from relevant data points when its
  value is `None`.

---

# Version 2026.2.24 (2026-02-23)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Handle empty XML-RPC responses for void CCU methods**: The CCU's
  `setInstallMode` method returns an empty HTTP response body instead of a
  proper XML-RPC response. The XML parser failed with
  `ExpatError: no element found`. The proxy now detects empty responses
  (expat error code 3 at line 1, column 0) and treats them as successful
  void returns, preventing `ClientException` when activating install mode.

---

# Version 2026.2.23 (2026-02-22)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Clear deleted schedule entries on CCU**: `DefaultWeekProfile.convert_dict_to_raw_schedule`
  now explicitly zeroes out `WEEKDAY` and `TARGET_CHANNELS` for unused groups
  (1-24) that are not in the schedule. This ensures that deleted schedule entries
  are properly deactivated on the CCU, since `put_paramset` only updates keys
  that are sent.

---

# Version 2026.2.22 (2026-02-22)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Schedule domain property for week profiles**: Add `schedule_domain` property
  to `WeekProfileDataPoint` and `WeekProfileDataPointProtocol` that returns the
  `DataPointCategory` (switch, light, cover, valve) for non-climate schedule
  devices. This enables consumers like the Home Assistant Climate Schedule Card
  to distinguish schedule types and adapt their UI accordingly.

---

# Version 2026.2.21 (2026-02-20)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Documentation audit and corrections**: Comprehensive review and update of ~20
  documentation files to match the current implementation. Key fixes include:
  corrected class names (`AsyncXmlRpcServer`, `AsyncRPCFunctions`,
  `AioJsonRpcAioHttpClient`, `CommandTracker`), updated API signatures for
  metrics emission functions (`emit_*` now use `key` parameter instead of
  `source`/`source_id`/`operation`), fixed coordinator access patterns
  (`central.state`, `central.hub_coordinator`, `central.client_coordinator`,
  `central.link`), corrected event types (`DataPointValueReceivedEvent`),
  updated constant values (`COMMAND_TRACKER_MAX_SIZE`: 500,
  `LAST_COMMAND_SEND_STORE_TIMEOUT`: 60), fixed exception hierarchy
  (`BaseHomematicException` as base), and updated sequence diagrams with
  correct `RecoveryStage` enum values and `EventBus` subscription patterns.

---

# Version 2026.2.20 (2026-02-19)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **LinkCoordinator for device direct link management**: Add `LinkCoordinator`
  as a high-level facade for listing, creating, and removing direct links
  between device channels. Includes `DeviceLink` and `LinkableChannel`
  dataclasses for enriched link data with translated channel type labels,
  device metadata, and link direction. The coordinator provides linkable channel
  discovery with role-based filtering. Exposed via `LinkFacadeProtocol` and
  wired into `CentralUnit` as `link` property.

- **Dimmer last-level tracking**: Add `last_level` property and
  `set_last_level` method to `CustomDpDimmer` for tracking the last non-default
  brightness level, enabling restore-to-previous-brightness workflows.

- **Channel link peer categories**: Add `link_peer_source_categories` and
  `link_peer_target_categories` properties to `ChannelGroupingProtocol` for
  exposing link role categories per channel.

- **Configurable device listing**: Add `get_configurable_devices` to
  `ConfigurationCoordinator` returning `ConfigurableDevice` dataclasses with
  resolved channel type labels, effective paramset keys (MASTER excluded when
  no writable visible parameters exist), and `MaintenanceData` from channel 0.
  Exposed via `ConfigurationFacadeProtocol`.

- **Paramset copy operation**: Add `copy_paramset` to
  `ConfigurationCoordinator` for copying writable paramset values from a source
  channel to a target channel. Filters non-writable and missing parameters,
  returns `CopyParamsetResult` with copy/skip counts and old target values for
  change tracking.

### Documentation

- **Architecture docs updated**: Add `ConfigurationCoordinator` and
  `LinkCoordinator` to Mermaid component diagram, Central Protocols listing,
  and coordinator categorization (new "Facade coordinators" category).
  Update `ChannelGroupingProtocol` description with new link peer category
  properties.

- **CLAUDE.md updated**: Update coordinator directory tree (7 → 9 files,
  add `configuration.py` and `link.py`). Add `ConfigurationFacadeProtocol`
  and `LinkFacadeProtocol` to Key Protocol Interfaces listing.

- **API reference updated**: Add `configuration` and `link` properties to
  `CentralUnit` members list in `docs/reference/api/central.md`.

---

# Version 2026.2.19 (2026-02-19)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **On-demand LINK paramset description fetching**: Add
  `get_paramset_description_on_demand` to `InterfaceClient` and
  `get_link_paramset_description` to `ConfigurationCoordinator` for fetching
  LINK paramset descriptions directly from the backend when needed. LINK
  paramsets are not cached during device discovery, so this API enables direct
  link configuration without requiring a full device reload.

---

# Version 2026.2.18 (2026-02-17)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Add translations for LINK paramset parameters**: LINK paramset parameters
  use `SHORT_`/`LONG_` prefixes (e.g. `SHORT_ON_LEVEL`, `LONG_RAMPON_TIME`).
  The translation lookup now strips these prefixes as fallback, matching the
  CCU WebUI behavior, and prepends the press-type label (e.g. "Tastendruck kurz"
  / "Button press short"). Added 138 custom parameter name translations and
  1,150 custom enum value translations covering all LINK paramset parameters
  (time bases, time modes, action types, profile actions, condition types,
  jump targets, driving modes, control modes, and more).

### Fixed

- **Fix delayed device creation failing on multi-interface devices**: When
  a new HmIP device was paired, the CCU sends `newDevices` on multiple interfaces
  (e.g. HmIP-RF and VirtualDevices) with the same device address.
  `_delayed_device_descriptions` was keyed by device address only, causing the
  first `add_new_devices_manually` call to consume descriptions from all
  interfaces, while the second call found nothing and failed with
  `No device description found`. Fixed by making `_delayed_device_descriptions`
  interface-aware (keyed by `{interface_id: {address: [descriptions]}}`).
  Also fixed: `DEVICES_DELAYED` event now only reports addresses for the current
  interface, and missing addresses in a batch no longer abort the entire operation
  (`continue` instead of `return`).

---

# Version 2026.2.17 (2026-02-16)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Preserve channel postfix when translation suppresses parameter name**: When a
  parameter translation resolves to an empty string (`""`) for a multi-channel
  data point, the channel disambiguation postfix (e.g. `ch13`) was lost because
  the truthiness check treated `""` the same as `None`. Changed to an identity
  check (`is not None`) so that an empty translation correctly yields
  `translated_name="ch13"` instead of removing the name entirely.

### Changed

- **example.py uses environment variables**: Hardcoded CCU credentials replaced
  with `os.environ` lookups. A lightweight `.env` loader reads variables from the
  project-root `.env` file at startup.

---

# Version 2026.2.16 (2026-02-16)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Translate custom data point postfix**: When a custom data point provides a
  `data_point_name_postfix` (e.g. `BUTTON_LOCK`), it is now translated via
  `get_parameter_translation` — the same mechanism used for generic data points
  and events. The translated postfix populates `translated_name` and
  `translated_full_name` in `DataPointNameData`.

---

# Version 2026.2.15 (2026-02-15)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **i18n: Allow multiple CentralUnit instances**: `set_locale()` is now idempotent —
  calling it again with the same locale is a no-op. When called with a different
  locale, it logs a message and keeps the original. Previously, creating a second
  `CentralUnit` raised `RuntimeError` because `set_locale()` was strictly
  one-shot.

---

# Version 2026.2.14 (2026-02-15)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Empty parameter translation suppresses parameter name**: When a CCU parameter
  translation resolves to an empty string (`""`), the parameter name is now omitted
  from `translated_name` and `translated_full_name` in `DataPointNameData`. This
  allows translations to explicitly suppress redundant parameter names when the
  channel name already conveys the meaning. `None` (no translation found) still
  falls back to the original untranslated name as before.

---

# Version 2026.2.13 (2026-02-15)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Extraction script: PNAME and easymode TCL parsing**: Added two new extraction
  sources to `extract_ccu_translations.py`:

  - `PNAME.txt` files with direct parameter name → label mappings
  - Easymode TCL files (`*_master.tcl`) for parameter → template variable
    resolution via `set param` / `${stringTable...}` patterns
  - Improved HTML entity decoding (`&quot;`, `&lt;`, `&gt;`)
  - Source merging refactored into `_merge_sources()` helper
  - Parameters: 841 → 1029 (+188), parameter values: 1256 → 1326 (+70),
    device models: 365 → 367 (+2)

- **Extraction script fixes**: Fixed multiple bugs in `extract_ccu_translations.py`
  that caused ~215 parameter translations to be missed:

  - Added `translate.lang.extension.js` and `translate.lang.js` as extraction sources
  - Added MASTER_LANG device-specific translation files as additional source
  - Fixed comment regex that destroyed `://` URLs inside string values
  - Fixed regex to target `langJSON` specifically (ignoring `HMIdentifier` blocks)
  - Added parsing of `langJSON` alias assignments after jQuery.extend blocks
  - Added handling of invalid JS escape sequences (`\'`, `\.`) for JSON compatibility
  - Added `channelDescription.js` and `deviceDescription.js` to template resolution

- **Custom translation cleanup**: Removed 17 redundant entries from
  `ccu_custom/parameters_*.json` and `ccu_custom/parameter_values_*.json` that are
  now correctly provided by the improved extraction. Added 67 channel-qualified
  override keys to ensure custom translations take precedence over extracted
  channel-specific translations.

- **Value-only translation fallback**: `get_parameter_value_translation` now
  has a three-tier lookup: channel-specific → parameter-specific → value-only.
  The new value-only fallback builds an index of standalone enum values mapped
  to their shortest (most generic) translation, so shared values like `true`,
  `false`, or weekday names resolve even for unknown parameters.

- **Weekday translations**: Added `show_weekday` value translations
  (Monday–Sunday) to `ccu_custom/parameter_values_*.json` (EN + DE).

- **Configurable channel filtering**: `get_configurable_channels` now applies
  CCU-compatible filtering rules: channels must have the VISIBLE flag set and
  must not have the INTERNAL flag. WEEK_PROGRAM channels are excluded as they
  are handled by schedule cards.

# Version 2026.2.12 (2026-02-13)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **CCU translation loading via pkgutil**: Replaced `Path.read_text()` with
  `pkgutil.get_data()` for loading CCU translation files. This avoids blocking
  file I/O detection in Home Assistant's event loop. Translations are now
  eagerly initialized at import time to prevent any later I/O on first use.

# Version 2026.2.11 (2026-02-13)

## What's Changed

### Improved

- **Robust JSON parsing with stdlib fallback**: When `orjson` fails to parse
  JSON from CCU Rega scripts (e.g., due to non-standard literals like `NaN` or
  `Infinity`), the parser now falls through to Python's stdlib `json` module
  which handles these edge cases gracefully.

- **Extended control character sanitization**: The JSON sanitizer now also
  escapes the DEL character (U+007F) in string values, in addition to the
  existing U+0000–U+001F range.

- **Diagnostic logging for JSON parse errors**: When a Rega script response
  fails to parse as JSON, the exact problematic character (Unicode codepoint),
  its position, and surrounding context are now logged at WARNING level to aid
  diagnosis.

### Changed

- **CCU translation API**: Renamed functions and properties for semantic accuracy:
  - `get_device_model_label()` → `get_device_model_description()`
  - `get_channel_type_label()` → `get_channel_type_translation()`
  - `get_parameter_label()` → `get_parameter_translation()`
  - `get_parameter_value_label()` → `get_parameter_value_translation()`
  - `Device.label` → `Device.model_description`
  - `Channel.label` → `Channel.type_translation`
  - `BaseParameterDataPoint.label` → `BaseParameterDataPoint.translation`
  - `BaseParameterDataPoint.value_labels` → `BaseParameterDataPoint.value_translations`
  - `CalculatedDataPoint.label` → `CalculatedDataPoint.translation`

# Version 2026.2.10 (2026-02-11)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **CCU translation extraction**: New script (`script/extract_ccu_translations.py`)
  that extracts human-readable translations from the OpenCCU/RaspberryMatic WebUI
  for channel types, device models, parameter names, and parameter enum values.
  Supports local OCCU checkout (`OCCU_PATH`) and remote CCU fetch (`CCU_URL`).
  Resolves the two-level stringtable indirection, URL-decodes Latin-1 characters,
  and strips HTML from values.

- **CCU translations loader module**: New module (`aiohomematic/ccu_translations.py`)
  providing typed lookup functions for CCU-sourced translations:

  - `get_channel_type_label()`: Channel type labels (e.g. `BLIND` -> "Jalousieaktor")
  - `get_device_model_label()`: Device model descriptions with `sub_model` fallback
    for abbreviated HmIP keys (e.g. `PS`, `SMO`, `BSM`)
  - `get_parameter_label()`: Parameter labels with channel-specific fallback
  - `get_parameter_value_label()`: Enum value labels with channel-specific fallback

  All lookups are thread-safe (double-checked locking) and asyncio event loop safe
  (lazy initialization, then pure dict reads with zero I/O).

- **Generated translation files**: 8 JSON files under `aiohomematic/translations/ccu_extract/`
  (4 categories x 2 locales: de, en) with 2500+ translation entries total.

- **CCU translation custom override layer**: New `aiohomematic/translations/ccu_custom/`
  directory with identically-named JSON files (empty by default). Keys in `ccu_custom/`
  override or supplement keys from `ccu_extract/` at load time and survive re-extraction.

- **Labels for calculated data points**: Calculated data points (dew point, enthalpy,
  frost point, etc.) now resolve human-readable labels via `ccu_translations`, matching
  the behavior of parameter-backed data points. Custom translations for all 10 calculated
  parameters are provided in `ccu_custom/parameters_{de,en}.json`.

### Documentation

- **ADR-0024**: Architecture Decision Record for CCU translation extraction
  (`docs/adr/0024-ccu-translation-extraction.md`)

---

# Version 2026.2.9 (2026-02-11)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **`parameter_tools` module**: New standalone module (`aiohomematic/parameter_tools.py`)
  providing pure-function utilities for working with `ParameterData` descriptions,
  independent of DataPoint instances:

  - **ParameterHelper**: Flag and operation checks (`is_parameter_visible`,
    `is_parameter_writable`, `has_parameter_events`), enum resolution
    (`resolve_enum_value`, `resolve_enum_index`), and step size calculation
    (`get_parameter_step`).
  - **ParameterValidator**: Value validation (`validate_value`, `validate_paramset`)
    and type coercion (`coerce_value`) against parameter descriptions without
    requiring a DataPoint instance.
  - **ParamsetDiff**: Type-aware comparison of two paramset snapshots
    (`diff_paramset`) with proper float equality handling.

- **`ConfigurationCoordinator`**: New high-level facade
  (`aiohomematic/central/coordinators/configuration.py`) for device configuration
  operations, exposed as `central.configuration`. Provides:

  - `get_paramset_description()` / `get_all_paramset_descriptions()`: Read parameter
    definitions for a channel.
  - `get_paramset()` / `put_paramset()`: Read and write paramset values with optional
    built-in validation.
  - `get_configurable_channels()`: Discover configurable channels for a device.
  - `get_parameter_data()`: Look up a single parameter description.

- **`ConfigurationFacadeProtocol`**: Protocol interface for the configuration facade,
  enabling dependency injection and testability for consumers.

# Version 2026.2.8 (2026-02-09)

## What's Changed

### Refactored

- **Extract `DeviceQueryFacade` from `CentralUnit`** (P1): Moved 12 query methods
  (`get_data_points`, `get_events`, `get_generic_data_point`, `get_custom_data_point`,
  `get_data_point_by_custom_id`, `get_event`, `get_event_groups`,
  `get_readable_generic_data_points`, `get_state_paths`, `get_install_mode`,
  `get_un_ignore_candidates`, `get_parameters`) into a new `DeviceQueryFacade` class
  (~348 LOC). CentralUnit retains one-line delegates for API compatibility.

- **Centralize circuit breaker management in `BaseBackend`**: Circuit breakers are now
  collected and managed by the base backend class via a `circuit_breakers` tuple.
  `all_circuit_breakers_closed`, `circuit_breaker`, and `reset_circuit_breakers` are
  implemented once in `BaseBackend`, eliminating duplicate logic in `CcuBackend`,
  `HomegearBackend`, and `JsonCcuBackend`.

- **Replace `hasattr` introspection in `ConnectionHealth.update_from_client`**: The method
  now accepts `ClientConnectionProtocol` instead of `Any` and reads `client.state` via
  the public API instead of reaching into `_state_machine`, `_proxy._circuit_breaker`, and
  `_json_rpc_client._circuit_breaker`.

- **Thread-safe `RequestCoalescer`**: The check-and-register operation is now protected
  by an `asyncio.Lock`, making it safe under Python 3.13+ free-threading. The lock is
  released before awaiting the actual request to allow concurrent coalescing.

- **Extract `OptimisticValueTracker` from `BaseParameterDataPoint`**: Consolidated 5
  optimistic-update-related slots into a single pure state management class
  (`aiohomematic/model/optimistic.py`, ~136 LOC). Manages apply, confirm, and rollback
  lifecycle with burst support and automatic rollback timeouts — no event publishing,
  logging, or I/O.

- **Extract `_DeviceAvailability` and `_DeviceFirmware` from `Device`**: Moved
  availability state management (UN_REACH, STICKY_UN_REACH, forced availability) and
  firmware version tracking / update operations into dedicated helper classes within
  `device.py`, reducing the main `Device` class complexity.

- **Split `support.py` into `support/` package**: The monolithic `support.py` module is
  now a package with three focused submodules:

  - `address.py`: Address parsing/validation with `@lru_cache`
  - `file_ops.py`: Async file system operations
  - `mixins.py`: `LogContextMixin` and `PayloadMixin` for structured logging

  The package re-exports all public symbols, so external imports remain unchanged.

- **Rename proxy lifecycle methods on `InterfaceClient`**: `initialize_proxy()` →
  `init_proxy()`, `deinitialize_proxy()` → `deinit_proxy()`,
  `reinitialize_proxy()` → `reinit_proxy()`.

### Added

- **`cleanup()` method on `CentralDataCache`**: Forces an expiration check on all
  interfaces, callable from scheduler or tests.

- **`@runtime_checkable` on client and model sub-protocols**: Added to
  `ClientStateMachineProtocol`, `ClientIdentityProtocol`, `ClientConnectionProtocol`,
  `ClientLifecycleProtocol`, `DeviceDiscoveryOperationsProtocol`,
  `ParamsetOperationsProtocol`, `ValueOperationsProtocol`, `LinkOperationsProtocol`,
  `FirmwareOperationsProtocol`, `SystemVariableOperationsProtocol`,
  `ProgramOperationsProtocol`, `BackupOperationsProtocol`, and several channel/device
  sub-protocols.

- **`_migrate_schema()` hook re-enabled in `BasePersistentCache.load()`** (P12): Schema
  version mismatches now attempt migration via `_migrate_schema()` before falling back to
  `VERSION_MISMATCH`. Default raises `NotImplementedError` so existing behaviour is
  preserved.

### Documentation

- **Device class section comments** (P8): Added 7 section markers
  (`# -- 1. Metadata & Identity --` through `# -- 7. Week Profile --`) to organize
  the Device class body.

- **DataPoint hierarchy diagram** (P9): Added class hierarchy documentation to
  `data_point.py` showing the 5-level parameter-backed chain and 2-level calculated chain.

- **Cache concurrency model** (P10): Added `Concurrency` section to `CentralDataCache`,
  `CommandTracker`, `PingPongTracker`, and `DeviceDetailsCache` documenting the
  single-event-loop assumption and PEP 703 implications.

- **Lazy cache expiration** (P11): Documented the intentional lazy expiration strategy
  and `_is_initializing` lifecycle in `CentralDataCache`.

- **Protocol selection guide** (`docs/architecture/protocol_selection_guide.md`):
  Decision tree for choosing among 115 protocol interfaces by use case, with guidance on
  naming conventions and interface segregation principles.

### Testing

- **Benchmark test suite** (`tests/benchmarks/`): Performance baseline tests for
  `CentralDataCache`, `CircuitBreaker`, `EventBus`, and `RequestCoalescer`.

- **Error-path test suite** (`tests/test_error_paths.py`, ~585 LOC): Comprehensive
  resilience tests covering `RequestCoalescer` burst scenarios, circuit breaker
  integration, cache expiration edge cases, and shutdown cleanup.

---

# Version 2026.2.7 (2026-02-09)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Paramset consistency checker**: Automatically detects missing parameters on HmIP/HmIPW
  devices after firmware updates. The HmIPServer (crRFD) on the CCU sometimes fails to
  refresh its stored parameter data after a firmware update, creating a mismatch between
  `getParamsetDescription()` (schema) and `getParamset()` (actual values). The checker
  runs as a background task after device creation and reports inconsistencies via:
  - Home Assistant Repairs (as `IntegrationIssue` with type `PARAMSET_INCONSISTENCY`)
  - Log warnings with affected device addresses and missing parameters
  - Diagnostics data (via `IncidentStore`)
    A factory reset of the affected device on the CCU resolves the issue.
    See [troubleshooting documentation](troubleshooting/paramset_inconsistency.md)
    and [ADR-0023](adr/0023-paramset-consistency-checker.md) for details.
    Based on [Homematic forum discussion](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?t=77531).

### Changed

- **Rename `_temporary_value` to `_unconfirmed_value`**: All internal references to
  `_temporary_value`, `_temporary_refreshed_at`, `_temporary_modified_at`,
  `write_temporary_value`, `_reset_temporary_value`, and related methods have been
  renamed to `_unconfirmed_*` / `write_unconfirmed_value` / `_reset_unconfirmed_value`.
  This clarifies the role of the second value tier in the three-tier resolution model
  (optimistic → unconfirmed → confirmed). Affected files: `data_point.py`,
  `hub/data_point.py`, `interface_client.py`, `interfaces/model.py`.

### Fixed

- **XML-RPC server race condition on multi-hub startup**: Fixed a race condition in
  `AsyncXmlRpcServer.start()` that caused "address in use" errors when multiple central
  units (e.g., two OpenCCU instances) started concurrently. The singleton server is now
  protected by an `asyncio.Lock` to ensure only one coroutine can bind to the port at a
  time. Also added proper cleanup of partial state if binding fails.

- **Optimistic rollback now clears unconfirmed value**: `_rollback_optimistic_value()`
  now calls `_reset_unconfirmed_value()` before restoring the previous confirmed value.
  Previously, the unconfirmed value survived the rollback and would override the restored
  value through the timestamp comparison in `_value`, undermining the rollback entirely.

### Documentation

- **Three-tier value resolution architecture doc**: New `docs/architecture/value_resolution.md`
  describing the full value resolution mechanism (optimistic → unconfirmed → confirmed),
  including timing, scope, interaction between tiers, rollback behaviour, and the hub
  sysvar variant.

- **Updated ADR 0020**: Added unconfirmed value tier to the value resolution description
  and documented that rollback clears the unconfirmed value.

# Version 2026.2.6 (2026-02-06)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **WeekProfileDataPoint**: Added device-level data points that serve as the central interface for schedule data — both for climate and non-climate devices. One data point per device exposes schedule metadata, target channel mappings, and delegates read/write operations to the underlying WeekProfile.

  New classes and types:

  - `WeekProfileDataPoint` / `ClimateWeekProfileDataPoint` in `aiohomematic.model.week_profile_data_point`
  - `WeekProfileDataPointProtocol` / `ClimateWeekProfileDataPointProtocol` in `aiohomematic.interfaces`
  - `ScheduleType` StrEnum in `aiohomematic.const` (`CLIMATE`, `DEFAULT`)
  - `TargetChannelInfo` dataclass in `aiohomematic.model.schedule_models`

  New device properties:

  - `device.week_profile_data_point`: Access the data point (or `None`)
  - `device.channel_groups`: Channel group configurations keyed by group number

  Data point properties:

  - `schedule_type`: Returns `ScheduleType.CLIMATE` or `ScheduleType.DEFAULT`
  - `schedule`: Cached schedule as `ScheduleDict`
  - `available_target_channels`: Human-readable target channel mapping (non-climate only)
  - `min_temp` / `max_temp`: Temperature bounds (climate only)
  - `value`: Number of active schedule entries (state property)

  Schedule operations (both types):

  - `get_schedule()`, `set_schedule()`, `reload_schedule()`, `fire_schedule_updated()`

  Climate-specific operations (`ClimateWeekProfileDataPoint`):

  - `get_schedule_profile()`, `set_schedule_profile()`
  - `get_schedule_weekday()`, `set_schedule_weekday()`
  - `copy_schedule()`, `copy_schedule_profile()`
  - `available_profiles`, `schedule_profile_nos`

- **Automatic profile sync from device**: `ClimateWeekProfileDataPoint` now binds the
  device's `ACTIVE_PROFILE` (IP) or `WEEK_PROGRAM_POINTER` (RF) generic data point.
  `current_schedule_profile` updates automatically when the thermostat switches profiles.

- **Climate CDP notification on schedule change**: When schedule data changes (e.g., after
  `CONFIG_PENDING=False` reload), the linked Climate CDP is automatically notified via an
  internal subscription, causing the HA Climate Entity to update.

- **`device_active_profile_index` property**: Returns the 1-based profile index from the
  device parameter (`int | None`). RF values are normalised from 0-based to 1-based.

### Changed

- **Schedule access removed from climate CDPs** (breaking change): All schedule methods
  and properties removed from `BaseCustomDpClimate`. Schedule operations are now exclusively
  available via `device.week_profile_data_point`. Removed: `available_schedule_profiles`,
  `schedule`, `get_schedule()`, `set_schedule()`, `get_schedule_profile()`,
  `set_schedule_profile()`, `get_schedule_weekday()`, `set_schedule_weekday()`,
  `copy_schedule()`, `copy_schedule_profile()`.

- **Schedule access removed from non-climate CDPs**: `has_schedule`, `schedule`,
  `get_schedule()`, and `set_schedule()` removed from `CustomDataPoint` base class
  and `CustomDataPointProtocol`.

- **Climate profile property renames** (breaking change): On `ClimateWeekProfileDataPointProtocol`,
  `active_profile` → `current_schedule_profile`, `active_schedule` → `current_profile_schedule`,
  `set_active_profile()` → `set_current_schedule_profile()`. This avoids a naming conflict with
  the device parameter `ACTIVE_PROFILE`. `copy_schedule` and `copy_schedule_profile` parameter
  renamed from `target_climate_data_point` to `target_data_point`.

- **Copy method refactoring**: `ClimateWeekProfile.copy_schedule` renamed to
  `copy_schedule_to` and `copy_profile` renamed to `copy_profile_to`. Both now accept
  `target_week_profile: ClimateWeekProfile` instead of `target_climate_data_point: BaseCustomDpClimate`.

- **HA-Addon renamed to HA-App** (breaking change): `SystemInformation.is_ha_addon`
  renamed to `is_ha_app`. The rega script `get_backend_info.fn` now returns
  `is_ha_app` instead of `is_ha_addon` in the JSON response.

### Fixed

- **CommandThrottle busy-wait replaced with asyncio.Event**: The background worker
  in `CommandThrottle` no longer polls with `asyncio.sleep(0.1)` (ASYNC110 violation).
  Uses `asyncio.Event` for efficient wake-on-enqueue, reducing idle CPU usage and
  improving command latency.

- **CallbackDataPoint ownership reset on unsubscribe**: When the owning `custom_id`
  fully unsubscribes from a data point, `_custom_id` is now reset to `None`. This allows
  re-registration with a different `custom_id` (e.g. after an entity_id rename in
  Home Assistant), preventing `AioHomematicException` on resubscription.

### Refactoring

- **DelegatedProperty expansion**: Replaced 56 boilerplate `@property` methods with
  `DelegatedProperty` descriptors across 23 files (central, client, model, store layers).
  This reduces repetitive delegation code while preserving the same runtime behavior.
  Properties that are overridden in subclasses (`category`, `state_uncertain`) remain
  as `@property` methods.

---

# Version 2026.2.5 (2026-02-05)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **i18n format specs**: Fixed `i18n.tr()` silently dropping format specifiers like `{interval:.3f}` because all kwargs values were converted to `str` before `format_map()`. Float format specs require the original type. Placeholders with format specs now render correctly in log messages.

- **Optimistic mismatch false positives**: Fixed false `OPTIMISTIC_MISMATCH` warnings when the CCU rounds float values (e.g., optimistic `0.3803…` vs CCU-confirmed `0.38`). Float values are now rounded to 2 decimal places before comparison.

- **Optimistic burst false rollbacks**: Fixed false `OptimisticRollbackEvent` and logbook entries during rapid command bursts (e.g., dimming a light through multiple values). Intermediate CCU confirmations are now silently accepted; mismatch is only evaluated on the final confirmation when all pending sends have been acknowledged.

- **Optimistic mismatch no longer fires rollback events**: `VALUE_MISMATCH` no longer publishes `OptimisticRollbackEvent`. When the CCU confirms a different value (e.g., clamping to minimum dimming level), the CCU value is silently accepted as authoritative. Rollback events are now only published for actual rollbacks (`TIMEOUT`, `SEND_ERROR`). This eliminates noisy logbook entries during normal CCU value corrections.

---

# Version 2026.2.4 (2026-02-05)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Optimistic updates**: Added optimistic state updates for data points to provide instant UI feedback before CCU confirmation. Data points immediately update their state when `send_value()` is called, then rollback if the CCU rejects the value or times out. Configure rollback timeout via `TimeoutConfig.optimistic_update_timeout` (default: 30.0s).

  New event: `OptimisticRollbackEvent` in `aiohomematic.central.events`

  New properties on data points:

  - `is_optimistic`: Check if data point has pending optimistic value
  - `optimistic_age`: Get age of optimistic value in seconds

- **Command priority queue**: Added three-tier priority system for command throttling to ensure security-critical commands bypass queues while bulk operations are deprioritized:

  - **CRITICAL** (priority 0): Security and access control commands (locks, sirens, alarms) bypass throttle entirely
  - **HIGH** (priority 1): Interactive user commands use normal throttle with high queue priority
  - **LOW** (priority 2): Burst detection automatically downgrades commands when burst thresholds are exceeded

  New enum: `CommandPriority` in `aiohomematic.client`

  CRITICAL priority is declared at the service-method level via `@bind_collector(priority=CommandPriority.CRITICAL)` on lock and siren service methods.

- **Command throttle**: Added configurable per-interface rate limiting for outgoing device commands (`set_value`, `put_paramset`). The throttle enforces a minimum delay between consecutive commands on the same RF interface to ensure smooth operation and prevent packet loss during bulk operations. Configure via `TimeoutConfig.command_throttle_interval` (default: `0.0` = disabled).

  New class: `CommandThrottle` in `aiohomematic.client`

- **CRITICAL queue purge**: When a CRITICAL command arrives (e.g., cover STOP, lock, siren), all pending queued commands for the same channel group are automatically purged from the throttle queue. This prevents queued movement commands from restarting a cover after STOP. Purged commands are cancelled with `CommandSupersededError` and return an empty result to callers. Channel group scope is respected — STOP on group 1 does not affect group 2 on the same device.

  New exception: `CommandSupersededError` in `aiohomematic.exceptions`

  New method: `CustomDataPoint.get_channel_group_addresses()` — returns all channel addresses in the data point's channel group

  New parameter: `purge_addresses` on `set_value()`, `put_paramset()`, and `CommandThrottle.acquire()`

### Removed

- **`CRITICAL_PRIORITY_PARAMETERS`**: Removed the frozenset from `aiohomematic.const`. CRITICAL priority is now declared exclusively via `@bind_collector(priority=CommandPriority.CRITICAL)` on service methods. The parameter-set-based detection was redundant since all lock/siren commands flow through decorated service methods.

- **Bulk operation context**: Removed `_is_bulk_operation_context()` from `BaseParameterDataPoint`. The `RequestContext` bulk operation flag was never used by the HA integration, making it dead code. The command throttle's built-in burst detection provides automatic LOW priority downgrade without requiring explicit context flags.

### Improved

- **Internationalization**: Added German and English translations for 8 new log messages in command throttle and optimistic updates subsystems
- **Type safety**: Fixed multiple mypy strict mode violations including Future/Task type parameters, call_later signatures, and protocol definitions
- **Code quality**: Removed lazy imports in production code, fixed import violations in test files to use public API

### Fixed

- **Syntax error**: Fixed unterminated triple-quoted string in `interfaces/central.py` that prevented module compilation
- **Type annotations**: Fixed missing `config` property in `CentralInfoProtocol` and `ConfigProviderProtocol`
- **Cover target levels**: Fixed `_target_level` and `_target_tilt_level` properties to check for `None` before calling `float()`, preventing type errors
- **Event bus access**: Fixed optimistic rollback event publishing to use `_event_bus_provider.event_bus` instead of non-existent `_event_bus` attribute
- **Optimistic updates in collector path**: Fixed optimistic values interfering with `is_state_change()` checks in parent service methods. When using `CallParameterCollector`, optimistic values are now deferred until `send_data()` instead of being applied immediately in `send_value()`, preventing sibling data point reads from returning premature values

# Version 2026.2.3 (2026-02-03)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Domain-specific schedule validation**: Added validation for schedule data based on device category (SWITCH, LIGHT, COVER, VALVE). The validation enforces that only appropriate fields are used for each device type:

  - **SWITCH**: Level must be binary (0.0 or 1.0), `level_2` and `ramp_time` are forbidden
  - **LIGHT**: `level_2` (slat position) is forbidden
  - **COVER**: `ramp_time` and `duration` are forbidden
  - **VALVE**: `level_2` and `ramp_time` are forbidden

  The validation is backward-compatible: when no domain context is provided (e.g., direct `SimpleSchedule.model_validate()` calls), all fields are accepted. Domain-specific validation is automatically applied when using `DefaultWeekProfile.set_schedule()`.

  New exports from `schedule_models.py`:

  - `SCHEDULE_DOMAIN_CONTEXT_KEY`: Context key for passing domain to Pydantic validators
  - `SCHEDULE_DOMAINS`: frozenset of categories that support schedules

# Version 2026.2.2 (2026-02-03)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **JSON control character sanitization**: Fixed `JSONDecodeError` when ReGa scripts (e.g., `fetch_all_device_data.fn`) return JSON containing unescaped control characters in device names or values. The `_sanitize_json_control_chars` function is now applied consistently to all JSON parsing from CCU responses, including script results in `_post_script` and nested JSON in `_get_serial`. The sanitization is now selective - it only escapes control characters **within JSON string values**, preserving structural whitespace (newlines between JSON objects, etc.) to avoid "unexpected content after document" errors.
- **CustomDataPoint schedule conversion**: Fixed `get_schedule()` and `set_schedule()` methods in `CustomDataPoint` to correctly convert between `ScheduleDict` (string keys, dict values) and `SimpleSchedule` Pydantic model (integer keys, Pydantic values). The methods now:
  - Accept both `ScheduleDict` and `SimpleSchedule` as input to `set_schedule()`
  - Properly delegate to `week_profile.get_schedule()` to ensure `ValidationException` is raised for unsupported devices
  - Convert between formats correctly in both directions

### Documentation

- **Week profile**: Added comprehensive documentation for `SimpleScheduleEntry` fields in `week_profile.md`, including:
  - Complete field reference with types, ranges, and validation rules
  - Device-type-specific meanings for `level` field (switch, light, cover, valve)
  - Condition types (`fixed_time`, `astro`, `fixed_if_before_astro`, `fixed_if_after_astro`)
  - Duration and ramp_time format examples
  - Field summary table and complete usage examples
- **Week profile module docstring**: Updated to reflect API changes from version 2026.2.1 (removed "simple" prefix from method names)

# Version 2026.2.1 (2026-02-02)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **LINK paramset validation**: Fixed `put_paramset` with `check_against_pd=True` for LINK paramsets. LINK paramsets are not cached during device initialization (by design), so validation is now automatically skipped for LINK calls to prevent "Parameter not found" errors. Fixes #2903.
- **ClimateWeekProfile type signature**: Fixed incorrect type annotation in `convert_dict_to_raw_schedule()` - removed `ClimateSchedule` from union type since the method only accepts `_ClimateScheduleDictInternal` (13-slot format). The Pydantic model `ClimateSchedule` uses a different structure (simple format with `base_temperature` and `periods`).
- **Schedule Pydantic models JSON serialization**: Added `_JsonSerializableMixin` to all schedule Pydantic models (`ClimateSchedule`, `ClimateProfileSchedule`, `ClimateWeekdaySchedule`, `ClimateSchedulePeriod`, `SimpleSchedule`, `SimpleScheduleEntry`) to support orjson/Home Assistant JSON serialization via `__json__()` method.

### Breaking Changes

- **Climate schedule API unified to Pydantic models only**: The old dual-format API (TypedDict + Pydantic) has been removed. All schedule methods now use Pydantic models exclusively.

  **Renamed methods in `BaseCustomDpClimate`:**

  - `simple_schedule` property → `schedule`
  - `get_schedule_simple_profile()` → removed (use `get_schedule_profile()`)
  - `get_schedule_simple_schedule()` → `get_schedule()`
  - `get_schedule_simple_weekday()` → `get_schedule_weekday()`
  - `set_simple_schedule()` → `set_schedule()`
  - `set_simple_schedule_profile()` → `set_schedule_profile()`
  - `set_simple_schedule_weekday()` → `set_schedule_weekday()`

  **Removed types from `const.py`:**

  - `ScheduleSlotType` enum
  - `ScheduleSlot` TypedDict
  - `ClimateWeekdaySchedule` type alias (now Pydantic model in `schedule_models`)
  - `ClimateProfileSchedule` type alias (now Pydantic model in `schedule_models`)
  - `ClimateScheduleDict` type alias (now `ClimateSchedule` Pydantic model)
  - `CLIMATE_MAX_SCHEDULER_TIME`, `CLIMATE_MIN_SCHEDULER_TIME`, `CLIMATE_RELEVANT_SLOT_TYPES`
  - `CLIMATE_SCHEDULE_SLOT_IN_RANGE`, `CLIMATE_SCHEDULE_SLOT_RANGE`, `CLIMATE_SCHEDULE_TIME_RANGE`

  **Migration:** Replace old TypedDict imports with Pydantic models from `aiohomematic.model.schedule_models`.

### Changed

- **ClimateWeekProfile**: Simple schedule format now uses Pydantic models for automatic validation. The existing user-facing format remains unchanged (no breaking changes), but input validation is now more robust with clear error messages.
- **DefaultWeekProfile**: Refactored schedule cache to use human-readable Pydantic models (`SimpleSchedule`, `SimpleScheduleEntry`) instead of complex dictionary format. The new format provides automatic validation, clear field names (e.g., `weekdays`, `time`, `level`, `duration`), and better developer experience.

### Added

- **schedule_models**: New Pydantic models for climate device schedules:
  - `ClimateSchedulePeriod`: Validates temperature periods with starttime, endtime, temperature
  - `ClimateWeekdaySchedule`: Validates daily schedules with base_temperature and periods
  - `ClimateProfileSchedule`: Validates weekly schedules (MONDAY-SUNDAY)
  - `ClimateSchedule`: Validates complete profiles (P1-P6)
- **schedule_models**: Pydantic models for non-climate device schedules:
  - `SimpleScheduleEntry`: Validated schedule entry with weekdays, time, condition, target_channels, level, duration, ramp_time
  - `SimpleSchedule`: Container for multiple schedule entries keyed by group number (1-24)

### Validation Improvements

Climate simple schedule validation now checks:

- Time format (HH:MM, supports 24:00 for end-of-day)
- Required fields (starttime, endtime, temperature)
- Time sequence (start < end)
- No overlapping periods
- Valid weekdays (MONDAY-SUNDAY)
- Valid profiles (P1-P6)

### Technical

- **week_profile.py**: Simplified implementation by using Pydantic models directly instead of manual conversion functions (~2300 lines removed)
- Added Pydantic mypy plugin to `pyproject.toml` for improved type inference
- Updated `WeekProfileProtocol` to accept any schedule type (removed `dict[Any, Any]` constraint)
- Updated type annotations in `Device`, `DeviceWeekProfileProtocol`, and `BaseCustomDataPoint`
- Added i18n keys for better error messages: `exception.model.schedule.invalid_weekday`, `exception.model.schedule.invalid_profile`

# Version 2026.2.0 (2026-02-01)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **EventBus**: Fix subscription leak for `DeviceLifecycleEvent` when stopping CentralUnit. The event type was missing from `clear_external_subscriptions()`, causing "LEAKED_SUBSCRIPTION" warnings during shutdown.

- **DeviceCoordinator**: Fix devices not appearing after factory reset and re-pairing. When a device was reset and re-paired with the same address, channel descriptions (e.g., `HEQ0128279:0`, `HEQ0128279:1`) were not added to cache because only the parent device address was checked. Added `_identify_missing_device_descriptions()` to detect and cache missing channel descriptions.

# Version 2026.1.57 (2026-01-31)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **JsonCcuBackend**: Implemented `get_device_details()` method via JSON-RPC `Device.listAllDetail`. This enables proper device name and interface registration for CUxD/CCU-Jack backends, matching the functionality of `CcuBackend`.

### Fixed

- **CUxD/CCU-Jack**: Fix interface registration for CUxD/CCU-Jack devices. Devices were incorrectly assigned `Interface.BIDCOS_RF` (default) because `JsonCcuBackend.get_device_details()` returned `None`, causing `get_data_points(interface=Interface.CUXD)` to filter out all CUxD devices. Interface is now registered during `_add_new_devices()` when device descriptions are cached.

- **InterfaceClient**: Fix `fetch_device_details()` to use interface from device data instead of client's interface. The legacy client used `Interface(device["interface"])` but the new implementation incorrectly used `self.interface`, which would register all devices with the calling client's interface when `Device.listAllDetail` returns devices from multiple interfaces.

# Version 2026.1.56 (2026-01-31)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **CUxD/CCU-Jack**: Fix data not updating after startup for polled interfaces. The `refresh_data_point_data()` method was using hardcoded `CallSource.HM_INIT` which caused data points with `ignore_on_initial_load` to be skipped during periodic polling. Changed default to `CallSource.MANUAL_OR_SCHEDULED` so polling works correctly while preserving initialization behavior.

# Version 2026.1.55 (2026-01-30)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Documentation**: Added comparison table of Homematic integrations in FAQ (Homematic, HomematicIP Cloud, Homematic(IP) Local)
- **Documentation**: Added raw schedule operations documentation (`get_schedule_profile`, `get_schedule_weekday`, `set_schedule_profile`, `set_schedule_weekday`)
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive `send_text_display` action documentation with all parameters (icon, colors, alignment, sound, etc.)
- **Documentation**: Added instructions for accessing optional settings in Home Assistant

### Test Infrastructure

- **OpenCCU**: Added comprehensive test fixtures for VirtualCCU with BackendMode.OPENCCU support
- **OpenCCU**: Added `pydevccu_openccu` session-scoped fixture running JSON-RPC server in separate thread
- **OpenCCU**: Added `central_unit_openccu` fixture with proper device lifecycle event handling
- **OpenCCU**: Added `test_backend_openccu.py` with backend detection, programs, sysvars, rooms/functions, and backup tests
- **OpenCCU**: Added `test_central_pydev_openccu.py` with full 397-device central unit tests

### Fixed

- **OperatingVoltageLevel**: Use user-configured `LOW_BAT_LIMIT` value instead of default for battery percentage calculation. This fixes incorrect battery readings when users have customized the low battery threshold (regression from #2281)
- **OperatingVoltageLevel**: Return `None` instead of clamped value when `voltage_max <= low_bat_limit` (invalid configuration)
- **OperatingVoltageLevel**: Ensure `calculate_operating_voltage_level` always returns `float` (0.0/100.0) instead of `int` (0/100)
- **Documentation**: Corrected client architecture references across all docs - replaced non-existent `ClientCCU`/`ClientJsonCCU`/`ClientHomegear` classes with correct `InterfaceClient` + Backend Strategy pattern (`CcuBackend`, `JsonCcuBackend`, `HomegearBackend`)
- **Documentation**: Fixed `HeartbeatTimerFiredEvent` key from `interface_id` to `central_name` in event reference
- **Documentation**: Added missing `RecoveryAttemptedEvent` field documentation (`max_attempts`, `stage_reached`, `success`, `error_message`)
- **Documentation**: Removed references to non-existent `USE_INTERFACE_CLIENT` feature flag in ADR 0013
- **Documentation**: Fixed outdated file paths in CLAUDE.md (docstring docs moved to `docs/contributor/coding/`)
- **Documentation**: Updated sequence diagram participant names to `InterfaceClient`
- **Documentation**: Replaced non-existent Handler class hierarchy with correct Backend Strategy architecture in sequence diagrams
- **Documentation**: Fixed action name typo `homeassistant.update_device_firmware_data` → `homematicip_local.update_device_firmware_data`
- **Documentation**: Fixed `copy_schedule` and `copy_schedule_profile` examples (corrected source/target entity usage)
- **Documentation**: Fixed broken links in troubleshooting docs (now point to Actions Reference)
- **Documentation**: Fixed GitHub issues URL in optional settings

# Version 2026.1.54 (2026-01-29)

  - Removed `docs/user/devices/` (hmip_srh_window_handle.md, hmip_swsd_smoke_detector.md)
  - Removed `docs/user/ccu_scripts/` (rename_sysvar_marker.md)

# Version 2026.1.52 (2026-01-28)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Derived Binary Sensors**: Implemented registry-based system for creating binary sensors derived from enum data points (ADR 0019)
  - Added `DerivedBinarySensor` calculated data point class
  - Added `DerivedBinarySensorRegistry` for declarative mapping definitions
  - Added `DerivedBinarySensorMapping` dataclass for mapping rules
  - New calculated parameters: `INTRUSION_ALARM`, `SMOKE_ALARM`, `WINDOW_OPEN`
  - Automatic creation of derived binary sensors during device initialization
  - HmIP-SRH, HM-Sec-RHS: Window handle sensor now provides additional `WINDOW_OPEN` binary sensor (ON when TILTED or OPEN)
  - HmIP-SWSD: Smoke detector now provides additional `INTRUSION_ALARM` and `SMOKE_ALARM` binary sensors (ON when alarm active)

### Improvements

- **Enhanced Data Point Validity**: Implemented comprehensive validation for data points including type checking, range validation, and proper None handling
- **Automatic STATUS Parameter Updates**: STATUS parameters (e.g., LEVEL_STATUS) now automatically update the main parameter's validity state
- **Type-Specific Validation**: Each parameter type (FLOAT, INTEGER, BOOL, ENUM, etc.) now has appropriate validation rules
- **None Value Semantics**: Clarified when None is a valid value (ACTION types, optional parameters) vs invalid (numeric sensors)

## Technical Details

- Added `has_valid_value_type` and `is_value_in_range` properties to BaseParameterDataPoint
- STATUS parameter events are now automatically subscribed and processed
- Warning logs for out-of-range values received from CCU
- Added `_OPTIONAL_PARAMETERS` frozenset (19 parameters) using Parameter enum values - excludes ACTION type parameters which are handled automatically
- Added missing Parameter enum values: INHIBIT, INSTALL_TEST, ON_TIME_UNIT, ON_TIME_VALUE, PARTY_START_DAY, PARTY_START_TIME, PARTY_STOP_DAY, PARTY_STOP_TIME, PARTY_TEMPERATURE
- Optional parameters include: color controls (COLOR, HUE, SATURATION, COLOR*TEMPERATURE, EFFECT), timing unit selectors (ON_TIME_UNIT, RAMP_TIME_UNIT, RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_UNIT, DURATION_UNIT), party mode (PARTY*\*), and special features (LEVEL_2, INHIBIT, INSTALL_TEST)
- Note: ACTION type parameters (\*\_VALUE like ON_TIME_VALUE, RAMP_TIME_VALUE) are automatically allowed to be None and don't need explicit listing

# Version 2026.1.51 (2026-01-27)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **CUxD/CCU-Jack regression prevention contract tests**: Added dedicated `test_cuxd_ccu_jack_contract.py` with 20 tests specifically designed to prevent regressions that have occurred during AI-assisted refactoring. Tests cover:

  - Interface classification (JSON-RPC vs XML-RPC constants)
  - Backend factory behavior (JsonCcuBackend creation)
  - Capability flags (ping_pong=False, rpc_callback=False)
  - Port configuration (HTTP 80 / HTTPS 443)
  - Enum value stability
  - Backend behavior (init_proxy/deinit_proxy are no-ops)

- **Comprehensive contract tests for stability guarantees**: Added contract tests that define the stable API contract for aiohomematic. These tests ensure that changes to core infrastructure require explicit consideration and MAJOR version bumps:

  - `test_capability_contract.py`: Backend capabilities (CUxD, CCU-Jack, CCU, Homegear)
  - `test_client_state_machine_contract.py`: Client state machine transitions and properties
  - `test_central_state_machine_contract.py`: Central state machine transitions and properties
  - `test_connection_recovery_contract.py`: Connection recovery behavior (exponential backoff, max attempts, stage progression)
  - `test_event_system_contract.py`: Event types, required fields, and immutability
  - `test_client_lifecycle_contract.py`: Client lifecycle methods (init, deinit, reconnect, stop)
  - `test_enum_constants_contract.py`: Enum value stability (Interface, Backend, DataPointCategory, DeviceProfile, ParamsetKey, etc.)
  - `test_configuration_contract.py`: Configuration class stability (CentralConfig, InterfaceConfig, TimeoutConfig)
  - `test_exception_hierarchy_contract.py`: Exception hierarchy (BaseHomematicException and subclasses)
  - `test_protocol_interfaces_contract.py`: Protocol interface definitions (runtime checkable, required members)
  - `test_hub_entities_contract.py`: Hub entity classes (Program, Sysvar, Metrics, Inbox, Update)
  - `test_subscription_api_contract.py`: EventBus subscription API stability
  - `test_backend_week_profile_contract.py`: BackendOperationsProtocol (47 tests) and WeekProfileProtocol (7 tests) API stability
  - `test_client_protocol_contract.py`: ClientProtocol and all 18 sub-protocols (124 tests covering identity, connection, lifecycle, operations, and method signatures)
  - `test_device_channel_protocol_contract.py`: DeviceProtocol, ChannelProtocol and all sub-protocols (273 tests covering identity, channel access, state, operations, configuration, and providers)

- **@unique decorator for all Enums**: Added `@unique` decorator to 70+ enum classes across 15+ files to prevent accidental duplicate enum values. Affected modules include `const.py`, `climate.py`, `cover.py`, `light.py`, `lock.py`, `siren.py`, `mixins.py`, `events/types.py`, `events/integration.py`, `json_rpc.py`, `rpc_proxy.py`, `metrics/events.py`, `store/types.py`, and `property_decorators.py`

### Changed

- **TimeoutConfig converted to Pydantic**: `TimeoutConfig` is now a Pydantic `BaseModel` with `frozen=True` for immutability. The API remains fully compatible with the previous `NamedTuple` implementation.

- **InterfaceConfig converted to Pydantic with CUxD validation**: `InterfaceConfig` is now a Pydantic `BaseModel` with proper validation:

  - For standard interfaces (HmIP-RF, BidCos-RF, etc.): port must be > 0
  - For CUxD/CCU-Jack: port is automatically set to `None` (ignored, JSON-RPC uses HTTP/HTTPS)
  - `interface_id` and `rpc_server` are computed fields

- **CentralConfig converted to Pydantic**: `CentralConfig` is now a Pydantic `BaseModel` with:

  - Automatic collection normalization (set/tuple → frozenset)
  - Computed private attributes for derived values (`requires_xml_rpc_server`, `session_recorder_*`)
  - Factory methods (`for_ccu`, `for_homegear`) preserved
  - All 30+ configuration fields with proper type hints and defaults

- **DeviceConfig/ExtendedDeviceConfig converted to Pydantic**: `DeviceConfig` and `ExtendedDeviceConfig` in `model/custom/registry.py` are now Pydantic `BaseModel` classes with `frozen=True` for immutability

- **ProfileConfig classes converted to Pydantic**: `ChannelGroupConfig`, `ProfileConfig`, and `RebasedChannelGroupConfig` in `model/custom/profile.py` are now Pydantic `BaseModel` classes with `frozen=True`

- **BackendCapabilities converted to Pydantic**: `BackendCapabilities` in `client/backends/capabilities.py` is now a Pydantic `BaseModel` with `frozen=True`. Backend implementations now use `model_copy(update={...})` instead of `dataclasses.replace()`

- **@override decorators added**: Added `@override` decorator from `typing` module to explicitly mark overridden methods across the codebase for improved code clarity and type checking

- **Final annotations for constants**: Added `Final` type annotations to key constants for improved type safety

### Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md: CUxD/CCU-Jack special handling section**: Added prominent "⚠️ CRITICAL: CUxD/CCU-Jack Special Handling" section at the top of CLAUDE.md to prevent AI-assisted refactoring regressions. Includes:
  - Comparison table (XML-RPC vs JSON-RPC differences)
  - Key constants to check before refactoring
  - Common regression patterns with ❌ WRONG / ✅ CORRECT examples
  - Refactoring checklist with pytest commands

See ADR-0018 for architectural context.

### Fixed

- **Client reconnect now works from INITIALIZED state**: Fixed an issue where clients stuck in `INITIALIZED` state (e.g., after a failed startup due to JSON parsing errors) couldn't be reconnected. The state machine didn't allow `RECONNECTING` as a valid transition from `INITIALIZED`. The fix transitions to `DISCONNECTED` first (which is the documented recovery path), then proceeds with reconnection. This enables automatic recovery when the initial connection was never established.

- **JSON parsing now handles unescaped control characters**: Fixed `JSONDecodeError: unexpected control character in string` errors that occurred when device names or descriptions on the CCU contained unescaped control characters (newline, tab, carriage return, etc.). The `Device.listAllDetail` JSON-RPC response is now sanitized by escaping control characters (U+0000 to U+001F) to proper `\uXXXX` sequences before parsing. This allows the central unit to start successfully even when the CCU returns malformed JSON.

# Version 2026.1.50 (2026-01-25)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Clean port handling for JSON-RPC-only interfaces**: Refactored `InterfaceConfig.port` from `int` to `int | None`. XML-RPC interfaces (HmIP-RF, BidCos-RF, BidCos-Wired, VirtualDevices) require a valid port > 0, while JSON-RPC-only interfaces (CUxD, CCU-Jack) now correctly use `None` instead of the previous workaround value `0`. This provides cleaner semantics and proper validation:
  - `InterfaceConfig` now enforces port validation based on interface type
  - `CentralConfigBuilder.add_cuxd_interface()` no longer passes `port=0`
  - TCP pre-flight checks correctly skip interfaces with `port=None`
  - Connection recovery checks simplified from `port is None or port == 0` to `port is None`

---

# Version 2026.1.49 (2026-01-25)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Hub data not refreshed after connection recovery**: Fixed an issue where hub data (System Update, Programs, Sysvars) was not refreshed after a successful reconnect. This caused the System Update DataPoint in Home Assistant to show stale information (e.g., "Update available" even after the CCU had completed the firmware update during the disconnect). The `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator` now accepts a `hub_data_fetcher` parameter and calls `fetch_system_update_data()`, `fetch_program_data()`, and `fetch_sysvar_data()` after successful data load. This ensures that hub state is synchronized immediately after recovery instead of waiting up to 4 hours for the next scheduled refresh.

- **Recovery fails for individual clients when others exist**: Fixed an issue where recovery for CUxD or CCU-Jack clients would fail with "Clients bereits erstellt" when other clients (HmIP-RF, BidCos-RF, etc.) were already created. The `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator._stage_reconnect()` now calls `_create_client(interface_config=...)` directly for the specific failing interface instead of `_create_clients()` which requires no existing clients.

- **Client state machine blocks recovery from INITIALIZED state**: Fixed an issue where clients stuck in `INITIALIZED` state (initialized but never connected) could not be recovered. The state machine now allows `INITIALIZED → DISCONNECTED` transitions, enabling `deinit_proxy()` to reset the client state for reconnection attempts. This was causing `InvalidStateTransitionError: Invalid state transition from initialized to disconnected`.

- **TCP check fails for JSON-RPC-only interfaces**: Fixed an issue where CUxD and CCU-Jack client creation would always fail at startup because the TCP pre-flight check was attempted on port 0. These interfaces use JSON-RPC (via the central JSON port 443/80) and don't have individual XML-RPC ports. The TCP check is now skipped for interfaces with `port=0`.

### Added

- **JSON-RPC port pre-flight check**: Added a TCP pre-flight check for the JSON-RPC port (80/443) before creating any CCU clients. CCU uses JSON-RPC for hub operations (programs, sysvars, system updates, etc.) in addition to XML-RPC for device communication. This check happens once at startup and ensures the JSON-RPC service is available before attempting to create clients.

---

# Version 2026.1.48 (2026-01-25)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **XML-RPC authentication headers not sent with TLS**: Fixed a critical bug where HTTP Basic Authentication headers were not being sent when TLS was enabled. The custom timeout transport classes (`_TimeoutTransport`, `_TimeoutSafeTransport`) did not pass the `headers` parameter to the base class `__init__()`. When `ServerProxy` receives a pre-built transport, it does not add headers to it - headers must be passed directly to the transport constructor. This caused all XML-RPC calls to fail with `ProtocolError: Unauthorized` when CCU authentication was enabled. The fix passes the authentication headers directly to the transport classes.

---

# Version 2026.1.47 (2026-01-25)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Authentication check fails for non-admin users**: Fixed a regression introduced in 2026.1.41 where users without ADMIN rights on the CCU would fail to connect via JSON-RPC. The `_get_auth_enabled()` method in `json_rpc.py` now catches `AuthFailure` exceptions in addition to `InternalBackendException`. When `CCU.getAuthEnabled` fails with "access denied (ADMIN needed 2)", this actually proves that authentication is enabled on the CCU (otherwise no permission check would occur). The method now correctly returns `True` in this case instead of propagating the exception.

---

# Version 2026.1.46 (2026-01-24)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **HA-Addon detection**: OpenCCU running as Home Assistant Add-on is now detected via `HM_RUNNING_IN_HA` or `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` environment variables. The new `is_ha_addon` field in `SystemInformation` indicates whether the backend runs as an HA-Addon.

### Changed

- **System update disabled for HA-Addons**: The `has_system_update` property returns `False` for HA-Addons. The System Update entity is not created and the `firmware_update_trigger` capability is set to `False`, as updates are managed by the HA Supervisor.

### Breaking Changes

- **System Update entity not created for HA-Addons**: The System Update entity is no longer created when running as an HA-Addon. Existing orphaned entities can be manually deleted in Home Assistant.

---

# Version 2026.1.45 (2026-01-23)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Free-threaded Python 3.14t support**: Added compatibility layer for Python 3.14 free-threaded builds (no GIL). The new `compat` module (`aiohomematic/compat.py`) provides:

  - `is_free_threaded_build()` and `is_gil_enabled()` detection functions
  - Conditional JSON backend: uses orjson on standard builds, falls back to stdlib `json` on free-threaded builds
  - `dumps()`, `loads()`, and `JSONDecodeError` with unified API across backends
  - Option flags (`OPT_INDENT_2`, `OPT_NON_STR_KEYS`, `OPT_SORT_KEYS`) compatible with both backends

- **CentralRegistry**: New thread-safe registry (`aiohomematic/central/registry.py`) for CentralUnit instances using copy-on-read pattern. Safe for both GIL-enabled and free-threaded Python builds. Replaces the module-level `CENTRAL_INSTANCES` dict.

- **Python 3.14t in CI**: Added free-threaded Python 3.14t to the test matrix in GitHub Actions workflow.

- **Package classifiers**: Added new classifiers to `pyproject.toml`:

  - `Programming Language :: Python :: Free Threading :: 2 - Beta`
  - `Natural Language :: English`, `Natural Language :: German`
  - `Environment :: No Input/Output (Daemon)`
  - `Topic :: Internet`, `Topic :: Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules`

- **Tests**: Added comprehensive test suites:
  - `tests/test_compat.py`: Tests for free-threading detection, JSON serialization, and round-trip behavior
  - `tests/test_central_registry.py`: Tests for CentralRegistry thread-safety and operations

### Changed

- **orjson is now an optional dependency**: orjson does not support free-threaded Python, so it has been moved to an optional extra. Install with `pip install aiohomematic[fast]` for faster JSON serialization on standard builds. The `compat` module automatically falls back to stdlib `json` when orjson is unavailable.

- **compat module functions use keyword-only arguments**: `dumps(*, obj, option)` and `loads(*, data)` require keyword arguments for consistency with project coding standards.

- **Migrated JSON operations to compat module**: All direct orjson usage replaced with `compat.dumps()` and `compat.loads()` in:

  - `aiohomematic/central/rpc_server.py`
  - `aiohomematic/client/json_rpc.py`
  - `aiohomematic/model/device.py`
  - `aiohomematic/store/persistent/session.py`
  - `aiohomematic/store/storage.py`
  - `aiohomematic/support.py`
  - `aiohomematic/i18n.py`

- **CENTRAL_INSTANCES replaced with CentralRegistry**: The module-level `CENTRAL_INSTANCES: dict[str, CentralUnit]` has been replaced with a thread-safe `CentralRegistry` instance providing atomic operations.
- ***

# Version 2026.1.44 (2026-01-22)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **SensorValueMixin**: New mixin class in `aiohomematic/model/mixins/sensor_value.py` that consolidates duplicated value transformation logic between `DpSensor` (generic) and `SysvarDpSensor` (hub). Provides standardized handling for value list lookup, converter functions, and string length validation.

- **Priority 1 Unit Tests**: Comprehensive unit tests for InterfaceClient, Coordinators, and Event System achieving 86%+ coverage:
  - `test_central_event_types.py`: Event type validation tests
  - `test_central_event_bus.py`: EventBus priority, batch publishing, and handler stats tests
  - `test_interface_client_lifecycle.py`: Client lifecycle and capability-gated operations tests
  - `test_interface_client_backends.py`: Backend-specific capability tests
  - `test_central_client_coordinator.py`: ClientCoordinator lifecycle and edge case tests
  - `test_central_event_coordinator.py`: Event routing tests

### Fixed

- Fixed `test_package_init.py` assertion to handle i18n fallback behavior when translation is not loaded during `runpy.run_module` context

### Changed

- **Async RPC server is now the standard implementation**: The async XML-RPC server (using aiohttp) is now the only RPC server implementation. The legacy thread-based XML-RPC server has been removed.
  - Removed `OptionalSettings.ASYNC_RPC_SERVER` feature flag (no longer needed)
  - Removed legacy thread-based XML-RPC server implementation
  - Removed `RpcServerTaskSchedulerProtocol` from `aiohomematic/interfaces/central.py`
  - Renamed `async_rpc_server.py` to `rpc_server.py` (consistent naming, no `async_` prefix)
  - Updated `CentralUnit` to use the aiohttp-based server directly
- **InterfaceClient is now the only client implementation**: The legacy client implementations (ClientCCU, ClientJsonCCU, ClientHomegear) and handler classes have been removed. InterfaceClient with the Backend Strategy Pattern is now the standard implementation.
  - Removed `OptionalSettings.USE_INTERFACE_CLIENT` feature flag (no longer needed)
  - Removed legacy client classes: `ClientCCU`, `ClientJsonCCU`, `ClientHomegear`
  - Removed handler classes: `DeviceHandler`, `LinkHandler`, `FirmwareHandler`, `SystemVariableHandler`, `ProgramHandler`, `BackupHandler`, `MetadataHandler`, `BaseHandler`
  - Removed `aiohomematic/client/ccu.py` and `aiohomematic/client/handlers/` directory
  - Added `aiohomematic/client/state_change.py` for state change tracking utilities
  - Added `aiohomematic/client/client_factory.py` for `ClientConfig` class
  - `ClientConfig` is now imported from `aiohomematic.client.client_factory` instead of `aiohomematic.client.ccu`

### Refactored

- **DeviceProfileRegistry data-driven registrations**: Consolidated repetitive device registration calls into data-driven tuples with loops, reducing boilerplate code:
  - `switch.py`: 11 separate `register()` calls → single data tuple with loop (~56% reduction)
  - `light.py`: 17 RF/IP Dimmer registrations → two data tuples with loops (~43% reduction)

### Removed

- `OptionalSettings.ASYNC_RPC_SERVER` - async server is now the default
- `OptionalSettings.ENABLE_LINKED_ENTITY_CLIMATE_ACTIVITY` - linked entity climate activity is now always enabled
- Legacy thread-based XML-RPC server (replaced by aiohttp-based implementation)
- `RpcServerTaskSchedulerProtocol` - only needed by removed sync server
- `tests/test_rpc_server_compatibility.py` - compatibility tests no longer needed
- `OptionalSettings.USE_INTERFACE_CLIENT` - InterfaceClient is now the default
- Legacy client classes: `ClientCCU`, `ClientJsonCCU`, `ClientHomegear`
- Handler classes in `aiohomematic/client/handlers/`
- `aiohomematic/client/ccu.py`

# Version 2026.1.43 (2026-01-21)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Pydantic integration for RPC response validation**: Introduced `aiohomematic.schemas` package with Pydantic models for validating and normalizing data from Homematic backends:
  - `DeviceDescriptionModel`: Validates device descriptions from `listDevices()`, `newDevices()` callbacks
  - `ParameterDataModel`: Validates parameter metadata from `getParamsetDescription()`
  - Normalization functions: `normalize_device_description()`, `normalize_parameter_data()`, `normalize_paramset_description()`
  - Validation occurs at all data ingestion points (RPC responses, cache loading)

### Changed

- **Removed voluptuous dependency**: Replaced voluptuous with Pydantic for data validation. The `validator.py` module now uses `ValidationException` instead of `vol.Invalid`. External consumers (e.g., Home Assistant integration) that used voluptuous-based validators (`channel_no`, `wait_for`, `address`, `host`) must implement their own validators.

### Breaking Changes

- Removed from `aiohomematic.validator`: `channel_no`, `positive_int`, `wait_for`, `address`, `host` (voluptuous schemas)
- Removed from `aiohomematic.validator`: `channel_address`, `device_address`, `hostname`, `ipv4_address`, `password`, `paramset_key` (validator functions)

# Version 2026.1.42 (2026-01-19)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Device availability events for forced availability**: `Device.set_forced_availability()` now publishes `DeviceLifecycleEvent` with `event_type=AVAILABILITY_CHANGED` when the device availability actually changes. Previously, only UNREACH/STICKY_UNREACH parameter changes triggered this event, meaning forced availability changes were not observable via the EventBus.

# Version 2026.1.41 (2026-01-19)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Startup resilience for authentication errors**: Implemented defensive client initialization to prevent false re-authentication requests when CCU starts after Home Assistant. The new approach uses a 3-stage validation:
  - Stage 1: TCP Pre-Flight Check - Wait for port availability before attempting initialization
  - Stage 2: Client Creation & RPC Validation - Verify backend communication
  - Stage 3: Retry with Exponential Backoff - Retry transient authentication errors before failing
  - New TimeoutConfig parameters:
    - `startup_max_init_attempts`: Maximum initialization attempts during startup (default: 5)
    - `startup_init_retry_delay`: Initial delay between retry attempts (default: 3s)
    - `startup_max_init_retry_delay`: Maximum delay after backoff (default: 30s)
  - Reuses existing parameters: `reconnect_tcp_check_timeout`, `reconnect_tcp_check_interval`, `reconnect_backoff_factor`
  - Only triggers re-authentication if all retry attempts are exhausted

### Fixed

- **Automatic reconnection after startup failures**: Fixed connection recovery coordinator to properly handle startup failures where backend (CCU/pydevccu) was not available during Home Assistant startup. Previously, the integration would remain in FAILED state indefinitely. Now:
  - Heartbeat timer starts automatically when central transitions to FAILED state during startup
  - Recovery attempts run every 60 seconds (configurable via `HEARTBEAT_RETRY_INTERVAL`)
  - Two distinct recovery paths:
    - **Startup failures** (client never created): TCP check → Client creation → Data loading
    - **Runtime failures** (client exists): TCP check → RPC check → Warmup → Stability check → Reconnection → Data loading
  - Port resolution for TCP checks now falls back to interface configuration when client doesn't exist
  - Integration automatically reconnects within 60 seconds once backend becomes available

# Version 2026.1.40 (2026-01-17)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **translation_key for data points**: Added `translation_key` property to enable translations for data points that previously lacked this feature. Now all data point types provide a consistent `translation_key`:
  - `GenericHubDataPointProtocol` and `CalculatedDataPointProtocol` now require `translation_key`
  - `BaseParameterDataPoint`: Derived from parameter name (existing, e.g., `set_point_temperature`)
  - `GenericHubDataPoint`: Uses category value (e.g., `hub_sensor`, `hub_button`)
  - `HmInboxSensor`: `"inbox"`
  - `HmUpdate`: `"system_update"`
  - `_BaseMetricsSensor`: Derived from sensor name (e.g., `system_health`, `connection_latency`, `last_event_age`)
  - `HmInterfaceConnectivitySensor`: `"interface_connectivity"`
  - `_BaseInstallModeDataPoint`: `"install_mode"`
  - `DpUpdate`: `"device_update"`
  - `CalculatedDataPoint`: Derived from calculated parameter name

### Changed

- **ChannelEventGroup as virtual data point**: Refactored `ChannelEventGroup` from a helper class to a virtual data point bound to the Channel. Event groups are now created during `Channel.finalize_init()` for each `DeviceTriggerEventType` present in the channel. Key changes:
  - `ChannelEventGroup` now extends `CallbackDataPoint` and follows the standard subscription pattern
  - New `subscribe_to_data_point_updated()` method replaces `subscribe_to_events()`
  - New `last_triggered_event` property tracks which event fired
  - New `device_trigger_event_type` property identifies the event type of the group
  - Event groups are accessible via `channel.event_groups` dict keyed by `DeviceTriggerEventType`
  - A channel can have multiple event groups (one per `DeviceTriggerEventType`)
  - `central.get_event_groups()` now returns channel-bound instances (reused, not created on-the-fly)
  - Added `subscribe_to_internal_data_point_updated` to `GenericEventProtocol`
  - `DataPointsCreatedEvent` now sends `ChannelEventGroupProtocol` for `EVENT` category instead of tuple of events
  - Migration guide: `docs/migrations/channel_event_group_migration_2026_01.md`

### Fixed

- **Legacy cache migration for climate schedules**: Fixed `ValidationException: Time 360 is invalid` error that occurred when starting with aiohomematic 2026.1.39 if the paramset cache contained legacy schedule data. The issue was that old cached data stored `endtime` values as numeric strings (e.g., `"360"`) instead of integers (`360`) or time strings (`"06:00"`). Added a new helper function `_endtime_to_minutes()` that handles all three formats, ensuring smooth migration without requiring cache deletion.

- **Coordinated cache clearing on version mismatch**: Fixed an issue where only one cache (device or paramset descriptions) would be cleared when its schema version was incremented. Now when either `DeviceDescriptionRegistry` or `ParamsetDescriptionRegistry` detects a version mismatch, **both** caches are cleared together via `CacheCoordinator.load_all()`, which returns `False` to signal that both caches need to be rebuilt from CCU. Additionally, both registries now override `clear()` to also clear their internal index structures (`_addresses`, `_device_descriptions`, `_address_parameter_cache`), ensuring complete cache invalidation. This prevents scenarios where one cache's index data could remain in memory after clearing, causing incomplete rebuilds. Added new `DataOperationResult.VERSION_MISMATCH` enum value to signal version mismatches for coordinated handling.

- **Sound player soundfile default handling**: Fixed `CustomDpSoundPlayer.turn_on()` to use the entity's current value or default as fallback when `soundfile` parameter is not explicitly provided, instead of always defaulting to `"INTERNAL_SOUNDFILE"`. Also moved `SOUNDFILE` to `visible_fields` in `IP_SOUND_PLAYER_CONFIG` profile configuration.

- **Backend detection timeout support**: Fixed `TypeError: ServerProxy.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'timeout'` error in backend detection. The `xmlrpc.client.ServerProxy` class doesn't accept a `timeout` parameter directly. Introduced custom `_TimeoutTransport` and `_TimeoutSafeTransport` classes that properly set socket timeout on HTTP/HTTPS connections, fixing backend detection functionality.

### Developer

- **Parallel test execution with pytest-xdist**: Added `pytest-xdist` for parallel test execution, providing ~3.5x speedup (from ~180s to ~51s). CI workflow updated to use `-n auto --dist loadscope`. Session-scoped `SessionPlayer` fixtures now load ZIP files once per test session and share across all tests.

---

# Version 2026.1.39 (2026-01-15)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Paramset description patching system**: Added a generic mechanism to patch incorrect `paramset_descriptions` returned by the CCU. Some devices return wrong parameter metadata (e.g., HM-CC-VG-1 with invalid MIN/MAX for SET_TEMPERATURE). The patching system:

  - Applies device-specific corrections during data ingestion (not on cache load)
  - Uses declarative patch definitions in `aiohomematic/store/patches/`
  - Matches patches by device_type, channel_no, paramset_key, and parameter
  - Automatically rebuilds cache when schema version changes (bumped to v3)

  New modules:

  - `ParamsetPatch`: Dataclass defining a patch (device_type, channel_no, paramset_key, parameter, patches, reason)
  - `ParamsetPatchMatcher`: O(1) lookup matcher that applies patches to parameter data
  - `PARAMSET_PATCHES`: Registry of all defined patches

  Initial patch:

  - **HM-CC-VG-1** channel 1 `SET_TEMPERATURE`: Fixes MIN/MAX from incorrect CCU values to 4.5/30.5

### Fixed

- **Paramset patching now works for channel paramsets**: Fixed two issues that prevented patches from being applied to channel paramset descriptions:
  - Device type comparison is now case-insensitive (consistent with rest of codebase)
  - Channel paramsets now use `PARENT_TYPE` (root device type) for patch matching instead of channel TYPE

---

# Version 2026.1.38 (2026-01-14)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Configurable backend detection timeouts via TimeoutConfig**: Backend detection timeouts are now centrally managed through `TimeoutConfig` instead of hardcoded constants. Added two new fields to `TimeoutConfig`:

  - `backend_detection_request: float = 5.0` - Timeout for individual XML-RPC/JSON-RPC requests (1s in test mode)
  - `backend_detection_total: float = 15.0` - Total timeout for the complete detection process (3s in test mode)

  The `detect_backend()` function now accepts an optional `timeout_config: TimeoutConfig | None` parameter to override the timeout values from `DetectionConfig`. This allows for consistent timeout configuration across the application and automatic `TEST_SPEEDUP` support. Timeouts can be configured in three ways:

  1. Use defaults from `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CONFIG`
  2. Set explicitly in `DetectionConfig(request_timeout=..., total_timeout=...)`
  3. Pass a custom `TimeoutConfig` to `detect_backend(timeout_config=...)`

- **Socket-level timeout for XML-RPC connections**: Added `timeout` parameter to `AioXmlRpcProxy.__init__()` that sets socket-level timeouts for TCP connections. This prevents backend detection from hanging indefinitely when connecting to unreachable hosts. The `request_timeout` is now passed as socket timeout during detection, ensuring TCP connection attempts fail quickly (default: 5s) instead of relying on OS-default timeouts (60-120s). Normal RPC operations continue to use no socket timeout (backward compatible).

- **Smart early abort on fatal connection errors**: Backend detection now intelligently distinguishes between transient and fatal network errors. When encountering fatal errors (ETIMEDOUT, EHOSTUNREACH, ENETUNREACH, or TimeoutError), detection immediately aborts instead of trying all remaining ports. For transient errors (ECONNREFUSED - port closed but host reachable), detection continues to the next port. This reduces detection time on unreachable hosts from ~30s (6 ports × 5s) to ~5s (1 port × 5s), a 6× performance improvement.

- **Service methods for manual configuration reload**: Added `Device.reload_device_config()` and `Channel.reload_channel_config()` service methods (decorated with `@inspector`) for external/manual calls to force a reload of device/channel configuration data. These methods are intended for use cases where CONFIG_PENDING events are unreliable (classic BidCos devices) or when manual cache updates are needed. They internally call `on_config_changed()` which remains a callback method for internal system use. The methods reload paramset descriptions, link peers, and all master parameter values from the backend.

  Typical use cases:

  - After changing master parameters on BidCos devices (CONFIG_PENDING unreliable)
  - Manual refresh of device/channel configuration
  - Forcing cache updates for debugging

### Changed

- **Removed hardcoded detection timeout constants**: Removed `_DETECTION_TIMEOUT` and `_DETECTION_TOTAL_TIMEOUT` constants from `backend_detection.py`. Default values are now provided by `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CONFIG.backend_detection_request` and `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_CONFIG.backend_detection_total`.

### Tests

- **New tests for timeout configuration**: Added six new test cases in `TestDetectBackendTimeout`:
  - `test_detect_backend_with_custom_timeout_config`: Verifies that a custom `TimeoutConfig` is correctly used
  - `test_detect_backend_timeout_config_overrides_detection_config`: Verifies that `timeout_config` parameter overrides `DetectionConfig` timeouts
  - `test_detect_backend_total_timeout_cancels_multiple_probes`: Verifies that `total_timeout` cancels detection even when multiple ports remain to be probed, ensuring detection is always aborted within the timeout period
  - `test_detect_backend_socket_timeout_on_unreachable_host`: Verifies that socket-level timeout prevents hanging on unreachable hosts (marked as slow test)
  - `test_detect_backend_aborts_on_host_unreachable`: Verifies that detection aborts after the first fatal error (EHOSTUNREACH) instead of trying all 6 ports
  - `test_detect_backend_tries_all_ports_on_connection_refused`: Verifies that detection continues through all ports when encountering transient errors (ECONNREFUSED)

### Documentation

- **Updated backend_detection.md**: Added section explaining timeout configuration options and usage examples with custom `TimeoutConfig`.

# Version 2026.1.37 (2026-01-13)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Type conversion for read operations (`convert_from_pd`)**: Added optional `convert_from_pd: bool = False` parameter to `get_paramset()` and `get_value()` methods across all client implementations (InterfaceClient, ClientCCU, ClientJsonCCU, DeviceHandler). When enabled, values returned from the CCU are automatically converted to their correct types (INTEGER, FLOAT, BOOL, ENUM, STRING) based on the ParameterDescription. This mirrors the existing `check_against_pd` parameter for write operations but without MIN/MAX validation (backend already enforced bounds). New helper methods `_convert_read_value()` and `_check_get_paramset()` handle the conversion logic.

### Changed

- **WeekProfile now uses automatic type conversion**: Both `ClimateWeekProfile` and `DefaultWeekProfile` now call `get_paramset()` with `convert_from_pd=True` in their `_get_raw_schedule()` methods. This ensures ENDTIME values are returned as integers and TEMPERATURE values as floats directly from the client layer, eliminating the need for manual type handling in schedule parsing code. This is particularly important for HM-CC-VG-1 virtual heating groups where the CCU returns values as strings.

- **Renamed write conversion methods for consistency**: Renamed `_convert_value()` to `_convert_write_value()` in InterfaceClient and DeviceHandler to clearly distinguish write operations from the new read conversion methods. The naming now follows a consistent pattern:

  - Read: `_convert_read_value()`, `_check_get_paramset()`
  - Write: `_convert_write_value()`, `_check_put_paramset()`

- **Simplified type handling in week_profile.py**: Removed redundant string fallback code in `ClimateWeekProfile.convert_raw_to_dict_schedule()`. With `convert_from_pd=True`, ENDTIME values are now always integers from the client layer. Helper functions `identify_base_temperature()` and `_validate_and_convert_weekday_to_simple()` retain int/string dual support since they may receive raw CCU data directly.

### Tests

- **New tests for convert_from_pd functionality**: Added `TestClientConvertFromPd` test class with 4 tests covering the HM-CC-VG-1 string-to-int conversion scenario:
  - `test_get_paramset_converts_string_to_int`: Verifies ENDTIME "360" → 360 and TEMPERATURE "17.5" → 17.5
  - `test_get_value_converts_string_to_int`: Verifies single value conversion
  - `test_convert_from_pd_preserves_correct_types`: Verifies already-correct types remain unchanged
  - `test_convert_from_pd_unknown_parameter_unchanged`: Verifies unknown parameters pass through unchanged

# Version 2026.1.36 (2026-01-13)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Schedule validation error for HM-CC-VG-1 heating groups**: Fixed `ValidationException: Time 360 is invalid` error when adding climate entities for virtual heating groups (HM-CC-VG-1). The CCU sometimes returns ENDTIME values as strings ("360") instead of integers (360) in the raw paramset. The `convert_raw_to_dict_schedule()` function in `ClimateWeekProfile` now handles both formats by checking if string values are numeric before conversion. This complements the fix in 2026.1.35 which addressed integer handling in `identify_base_temperature()`.

---

# Version 2026.1.35 (2026-01-13)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Schedule validation error on device initialization**: Fixed `ValidationException: Time 360 is invalid` error occurring when heating group devices (VirtualDevices interface) are initialized. The `identify_base_temperature()` function in `week_profile.py` incorrectly assumed all endtime values in the schedule cache are formatted strings ("06:00"), but during initial cache loading they can be raw integers (360 minutes) directly from the CCU. The function now handles both integer and string formats by checking the type before conversion. This fixes climate entity creation failures and recurring errors on Home Assistant startup. (Fixes #2797)

- **Type safety for ScheduleSlot**: Updated `ScheduleSlot` TypedDict to correctly declare `endtime: str | int` instead of `endtime: str`. This reflects the actual behavior where the CCU always returns integers (minutes since midnight) while internal conversion may use string format. Fixes mypy type checking errors in `week_profile.py`.

---

# Version 2026.1.34 (2026-01-13)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **CUxD/CCU-Jack unnecessary reconnects via MQTT**: Fixed false positive connection loss detection for CUxD and CCU-Jack interfaces when used with Homematic(IP) Local MQTT bridge. These interfaces use JSON-RPC without ping/pong support and receive events via MQTT, causing `callback_warn_interval` checks to incorrectly trigger reconnects every ~4 minutes. Both `is_callback_alive()` and `is_connected()` now check `ping_pong` capability to skip callback timeout validation for MQTT-based interfaces.

- **Syntax error in device_ops.py**: Fixed IndentationError in `_validate_and_convert_value()` method that prevented module import. Restored missing value conversion and MIN/MAX validation code block.

### Changed

- **Schedule cache now uses pessimistic update strategy**: Climate schedule cache (`ClimateWeekProfile` and `DefaultWeekProfile`) is no longer updated optimistically when calling `set_schedule()`, `set_profile()`, or `set_weekday()`. The cache is now updated only after receiving `CONFIG_PENDING = False` from the CCU via `reload_and_cache_schedule()`. This ensures the cache always reflects the actual CCU state, eliminating race conditions and inconsistencies. The cache remains essential for performance (avoiding RPC calls on reads) and event optimization (publishing events only when data changes). UI components like the Climate Schedule Card work seamlessly with this approach due to their built-in loading states and optimistic local updates.

- **Enhanced schedule temperature tests**: Extended tests for `set_simple_schedule_weekday` and `set_simple_schedule_profile` to verify correct behavior when integer temperatures are provided. Tests now explicitly verify that integer-to-float conversion happens in `_convert_value` (inside `put_paramset`) based on paramset descriptions, rather than in `week_profile.py`. This ensures type conversion follows the established pattern where the client layer handles all type conversions based on CCU parameter definitions.

### Documentation

- **CLAUDE.md - Schedule Cache Management**: Added comprehensive section documenting the pessimistic schedule cache update strategy, including cache update flow diagram, implementation details, and integration guidelines for Home Assistant Climate Schedule Card. Includes timeline diagrams showing the ~0.5-2 second delay between `set_schedule()` calls and cache updates via `CONFIG_PENDING`.

- **CLAUDE.md - Homematic(IP) Local Integration**: Added comprehensive section on "Integration with Homematic(IP) Local" explaining MQTT-based event flow for CUxD/CCU-Jack, capability-based callback health checks, and debugging guidance for MQTT integration issues.

---

# Version 2026.1.33 (2026-01-12)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **LINK paramsets causing false "incomplete device data" issues**: LINK paramsets are now excluded from paramset fetch operations and completeness checks. LINK paramsets are only relevant for device linking (direct associations) and are fetched dynamically when links are configured. Previously, failed LINK fetches (which occur when no links exist) caused devices to be incorrectly flagged as having incomplete data, triggering unnecessary repair issues in Home Assistant.

- **Empty paramset descriptions not being cached**: Fixed issue where paramset descriptions that return an empty dict `{}` (valid response) were incorrectly treated as missing. HmIP base device addresses and some channel types return empty MASTER or VALUES paramsets which is valid behavior. The fix uses `is not None` check instead of truthy check in all paramset fetch code paths (`get_paramset_descriptions`, `fetch_paramset_descriptions`, and `fetch_paramset_description`), ensuring empty dicts are properly cached.

### Changed

- **Skip LINK paramsets during device initialization**: LINK paramset descriptions are no longer fetched during initial device creation or CONFIG_PENDING reload. This reduces startup time, eliminates spurious error messages for non-linked devices, and prevents false positive "incomplete device data" warnings. Link functionality remains fully supported - LINK paramsets are fetched on-demand when link operations are performed.

- **Improved log message clarity**: Changed "devices" to "device/channel descriptions" in paramset fetch logging for accuracy, since the count includes both device and channel entries.

---

# Version 2026.1.32 (2026-01-12)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **O(N²) performance issue during device creation**: Fixed severe performance regression introduced in 2026.1.31 where `DataFetchCompletedEvent` was published after each individual device's paramset fetch, causing N cache saves for N devices. The event is now published once after the entire batch completes, reducing startup time from ~210 seconds to ~17 seconds for 397 devices (13x improvement).

- **put_paramset fails on HM-CC-VG-1**: Fixed `TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'str'` when calling `put_paramset` on HM-CC-VG-1. This device returns `MIN`/`MAX` values as strings instead of numbers in paramset descriptions. Now converts these values to the correct numeric type before comparison.

### Changed

- Enable schedule for HM-CC-VG-1

---

# Version 2026.1.31 (2026-01-12)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Schedule temperature values not updating on HM-TC-IT-WM-W-EU**: Fixed issue where temperature values in simple weekly schedules were sent as integers to the CCU, causing them to be silently ignored. The CCU requires temperature parameters as floats. Added explicit `float()` conversions in `convert_dict_to_raw_schedule()`, `_validate_and_convert_simple_to_weekday()`, and `_fillup_weekday_data()` to ensure all temperature values are sent as floats regardless of user input type. This fixes schedule temperature updates for HM-TC-IT-WM-W-EU and other Homematic RF thermostats when using `set_schedule_simple_weekday`.

- **Event-based cache persistence for paramset descriptions**: Implemented automatic cache persistence using `DataFetchCompletedEvent` to prevent race conditions where paramsets were fetched but not saved before shutdown. The `CacheCoordinator` now subscribes to data fetch completion events and automatically persists caches when changes are detected.

- **Paramset completeness validation before device creation**: Added validation after paramset fetch operations to ensure all required paramsets are in cache before starting device creation. If paramsets are still missing after fetch attempts, creation of the new devices in this batch is aborted (existing devices remain unaffected), the partial cache is persisted for diagnostics, and an `INCOMPLETE_DEVICE_DATA` integration issue event is published to allow the Home Assistant integration to create a repair issue.

### Changed

- **DataFetchCompletedEvent operation is now enum-based**: Changed `DataFetchCompletedEvent.operation` from `str` to `DataFetchOperation` enum for type safety. Use `DataFetchOperation.FETCH_PARAMSET_DESCRIPTIONS` or `DataFetchOperation.FETCH_DEVICE_DESCRIPTIONS` instead of string literals.

- **Optimized cache save operations**: Introduced `save_if_changed()` method that only writes to disk when `has_unsaved_changes=True`, avoiding unnecessary disk I/O during shutdown when event-based auto-save has already persisted changes.

- **Improved cache save logging**: Added detailed debug logging for cache save operations showing content keys and sizes to aid in troubleshooting cache-related issues.

### Added

- **Test for integer temperature conversion in schedules**: Added `test_rf_thermostat_simple_schedule_integer_temperature_conversion` to verify that integer temperatures in YAML are correctly converted to floats before being sent to the CCU. This test ensures the fix for issue #2789 and prevents regression.

- **Integration issue for incomplete device data**: Added new `IntegrationIssueType.INCOMPLETE_DEVICE_DATA` that is published via `SystemStatusChangedEvent` when devices cannot be created due to missing paramset descriptions after fetch attempts. The issue includes the affected device addresses and can be used by the Home Assistant integration to create repair issues alerting users to potential CCU data corruption or communication problems.

- **Schedule test for HM-TC-IT-WM-W-EU** (#2785): Added test coverage for weekly program schedule operations on RF thermostats.

---

# Version 2026.1.30 (2026-01-11)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Device availability not reset after CCU restart**: The state transition sequence during reconnect is `reconnecting → disconnected → connecting → connected`. The availability reset only triggered when `old_state` was in `(DISCONNECTED, FAILED, RECONNECTING)`, but the final transition has `old_state=CONNECTING`. Added `CONNECTING` to the list of states that trigger availability reset.

- **Race condition in client state event processing**: Events from the EventBus may be processed out of order (e.g., `disconnected` event processed after `connected` event). Now checks the current client state before marking devices unavailable, preventing incorrect availability changes when the client has already recovered.

---

# Version 2026.1.29 (2026-01-11)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Connectivity sensors not updating during CCU restart**: Interface connectivity binary sensors now subscribe to `ClientStateChangedEvent` for immediate reactive updates instead of only updating during scheduled refresh cycles.

- **CuXD devices not created when paramset_descriptions missing**: When device_descriptions were already cached but paramset_descriptions were missing (e.g., from a previous interrupted run), devices were skipped with "Nothing to add/update". Now properly detects missing paramset_descriptions by comparing expected PARAMSETS from device_description against cached paramsets, ensuring both caches stay synchronized.

---

# Version 2026.1.28 (2026-01-10)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- **Comprehensive Capabilities Pattern Migration**: All `supports_*` properties have been migrated to a unified Capabilities pattern.

  - **Entity Capabilities** (frozen dataclasses):

    - `LightCapabilities`: `brightness`, `transition`, `color_temperature`, `hs_color`, `effects`
    - `SirenCapabilities`: `duration`, `lights`, `tones`, `soundfiles`
    - `LockCapabilities`: `open`
    - `ClimateCapabilities`: `profiles`

  - **Static capabilities** now accessed via `entity.capabilities.<name>`:

    - `data_point.supports_schedule` → `data_point.has_schedule`
    - `central.supports_ping_pong` → `central.has_ping_pong`

  - **BackendCapabilities**: Removed `supports_*` prefix from all 19 fields:

    - `capabilities.supports_ping_pong` → `capabilities.ping_pong`
    - `capabilities.supports_backup` → `capabilities.backup`
    - (and all other fields)

  - **Handler classes**: All `supports_*` → `has_*`:

    - `handler.supports_linking` → `handler.has_linking`
    - `handler.supports_programs` → `handler.has_programs`
    - (and all other handlers)

  - **ClientConfig**: All `supports_*` → `has_*`:
    - `config.supports_linking` → `config.has_linking`
    - `config.supports_ping_pong` → `config.has_ping_pong`

### Added

- **Faster Connectivity Detection** (#2767): Improved connection loss detection from ~240s to ~20s:

  - Added `ping_timeout` (10s) for ping/connectivity check operations
  - Added `connectivity_error_threshold` (1) - single failure marks interface as disconnected
  - Reduced `callback_warn_interval` from 10 minutes to 3 minutes
  - Immediate device unavailability marking when client state changes to DISCONNECTED/FAILED
  - Fixed system health score defaulting to 100% before connections established (now shows 0%)

- **Interface Connectivity Binary Sensors**: New hub-level binary sensors showing per-interface connectivity status:

  - `HmInterfaceConnectivitySensor` class for each interface (HmIP-RF, BidCos-RF, etc.)
  - Shows ON when interface is connected and operational
  - Shows OFF when interface is disconnected, failed, or degraded
  - Always available (never shows unavailable since its purpose is to show connection state)
  - Refreshed automatically via scheduler at the same interval as metrics

- **New protocol**: `HubBinarySensorDataPointProtocol` for hub-level binary sensor data points

- **New Capabilities Dataclasses** in `aiohomematic/model/custom/capabilities/`:

  - `LightCapabilities`, `SirenCapabilities`, `LockCapabilities`, `ClimateCapabilities`
  - All use `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)` for immutability and performance
  - Predefined constants for common capability sets

- **Comprehensive test coverage for ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator** (90+ tests):
  - Unit tests for `InterfaceRecoveryState` dataclass (retry logic, exponential backoff, state transitions)
  - Tests for all recovery stages (TCP check, RPC check, stability check, reconnect, data load)
  - Tests for event handlers (`_on_connection_lost`, `_on_circuit_breaker_tripped`, `_on_circuit_breaker_state_changed`)
  - Tests for state machine transitions (RECOVERING, RUNNING, DEGRADED, FAILED)
  - Tests for heartbeat timer and incident recording
  - Tests for exception handling (CancelledError, generic exceptions)
  - Tests for edge cases (shutdown during recovery, max retries, JSON-RPC port fallback)

---

# Version 2026.1.27 (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix recovery stuck in infinite retry loop after CCU restart** (follow-up to GitHub #2757):
  - Reset XML-RPC proxy transport before RPC availability check during recovery. After CCU restart, the proxy's HTTP connection enters an inconsistent state (ResponseNotReady) which caused `system.listMethods` calls to fail silently
  - Fix proxy lookup to handle both direct client proxy (`client._proxy`) and backend proxy (`client._backend._proxy`) for InterfaceClient architecture
  - Add logging when RPC check fails during recovery for better debugging

---

# Version 2026.1.25 (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix persistent ping_pong_mismatch repair issues after CCU restart** (GitHub #2757):
  - Fix central state stuck at "recovering" after successful recovery by correcting the order of operations in `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator._start_recovery()` - now removes interface from active_recoveries before checking transition state
  - Add immediate connection repair notification when recovery starts - emits `SystemStatusChangedEvent(connection_state=(interface_id, False))` so users see feedback immediately instead of waiting for recovery to fail
  - Emit connection restored event when recovery succeeds to clear the repair notification

---

# Version 2026.1.24 (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- **Strongly typed events and IntegrationIssue**: Multiple event classes now use typed enums instead of string comparisons. This prevents consumer errors from incorrect string matching and provides better IDE support:

  - **IntegrationIssue**:

    - `issue.severity` is now `IntegrationIssueSeverity` enum
    - New `issue.issue_type` field as `IntegrationIssueType` enum
    - `issue.mismatch_count` is now `int | None`
    - `issue.mismatch_type` is now `PingPongMismatchType | None`

  - **ClientStateChangedEvent**: `old_state` and `new_state` are now `ClientState` enum (previously `str`)

  - **CentralStateChangedEvent**: `old_state` and `new_state` are now `CentralState` enum (previously `str`)

  - **DataRefreshTriggeredEvent / DataRefreshCompletedEvent**: `refresh_type` is now `DataRefreshType` enum (previously `str`)

  - **ProgramExecutedEvent**: `triggered_by` is now `ProgramTrigger` enum (previously `str`)

  - See migration guide: `docs/migrations/strongly_typed_events_2026_01.md`

### Added

- **New enums**: `DataRefreshType` and `ProgramTrigger` for strongly typed event fields

---

# Version 2026.1.23 (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix list_device() returning empty list treated as error**: The `init_proxy()` method now correctly handles empty device lists from interfaces that don't support RPC callbacks. Previously, an empty device list was incorrectly treated as a connection failure because the code used a truthy check (`if device_descriptions :=`) instead of a None check. Now uses `is not None` to properly distinguish between "no devices" (success) and "list_devices failed" (failure).

---

# Version 2026.1.22 (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix leaked EventBus subscriptions on central stop**: Six internal subscription leaks have been fixed:

  - `SysvarStateChangedEvent` subscriptions in `HubCoordinator` were not being cleaned up (72 subscriptions per central)
  - `HealthRecordedEvent` subscription in `ClientCoordinator` was stored but never unsubscribed
  - `DeviceRemovedEvent` subscription in `CacheCoordinator` - the existing `stop()` method was not being called
  - `DataPointValueReceivedEvent` subscriptions in `EventCoordinator` were not being cleaned up
  - `DataPointStatusReceivedEvent` subscriptions in `EventCoordinator` were not being cleaned up
  - `SystemStatusChangedEvent` subscriptions in `CentralUnit`, `InterfaceClient`, and `ClientCCU` were not being cleaned up

  The `HubCoordinator` and `EventCoordinator` now have `clear()` methods, `CacheCoordinator.stop()` is called during central shutdown, and client `stop()` methods now properly unsubscribe from system status events.

### Added

- **New `EventBus.clear_external_subscriptions()` method**: Clears subscriptions for event types that are subscribed to by external consumers (like Home Assistant integration). This includes `DataPointStateChangedEvent`, `DeviceRemovedEvent`, `DeviceStateChangedEvent`, `FirmwareStateChangedEvent`, and `LinkPeerChangedEvent`. The method is called during central shutdown as a fallback cleanup for external subscriptions that were not properly unsubscribed.

---

# Version 2026.1.21 (2026-01-09)

## What's Changed

### Fixed

- **Fix state machine transition error on unload**: Allow transition from `FAILED` to `DISCONNECTED` state. This fixes `InvalidStateTransitionError` when unloading the Home Assistant integration while a client is in failed state. Previously, `deinit_proxy()` could not cleanly shut down a failed client.

---

# Version 2026.1.20 (2026-01-08)

## What's Changed

### Changed

- **Eliminate dynamic import in `CentralConfig.create_central()`**: The circular import between `config.py` and `central_unit.py` has been resolved using Dependency Inversion with a new `CentralConfigProtocol`. This eliminates the Home Assistant warning: `Detected blocking call to import_module with args ('aiohomematic.central.central_unit',)`.

- **Eliminate all remaining lazy imports**: All `noqa: PLC0415` markers have been removed from production code. Circular imports have been resolved through module restructuring:
  - Event types (`Event`, `EventPriority`, state change events) moved to `central/events/types.py`
  - `LogContextProtocol` moved to `_log_context_protocol.py` in root package
  - Handler utilities now imported at top-level
  - Metrics imports now at top-level in `circuit_breaker.py`

### Added

- **New `CentralConfigProtocol`**: A protocol interface in `interfaces/central.py` that defines the configuration contract, enabling `CentralUnit` to depend on the protocol rather than the concrete `CentralConfig` class.

- **New `central/events/types.py` module**: Contains foundational event types to break circular import chains:

  - `Event` base class
  - `EventPriority` enum
  - `CircuitBreakerStateChangedEvent`, `CircuitBreakerTrippedEvent`
  - `ClientStateChangedEvent`, `CentralStateChangedEvent`, `HealthRecordedEvent`

- **New `_log_context_protocol.py` module**: Minimal leaf module containing `LogContextProtocol` to avoid triggering package initialization chains.

### Removed

- **`CentralConfig.create_json_rpc_client()` method removed**: This method was moved inline into `CentralUnit.json_rpc_client` property. External consumers should not have been using this method as it required a `CentralUnit` instance as parameter.

### Internal

- `CentralUnit.__init__` now accepts `CentralConfigProtocol` instead of `CentralConfig`
- `ConfigProviderProtocol.config` now returns `CentralConfigProtocol`
- `ClientDependenciesProtocol.config` now returns `CentralConfigProtocol`
- Event consumer modules now import from `central/events/types.py` directly
- `property_decorators.py` imports `LogContextProtocol` from root package module

# Version 2026.1.19 (2026-01-08)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- **`CentralConfig.create_central()` is now async**: Prevents "Detected blocking call" warnings in Home Assistant 2026.1.0+ by running all blocking I/O operations (`os.path.exists`, `os.makedirs`) in a thread pool executor.

  ```python
  # Before
  central = config.create_central()

  # After
  central = await config.create_central()
  ```

- **`CentralConfig.check_config()` is now async**: Configuration validation now runs in executor to avoid blocking.

- **`check_config()` function is now async**: Module-level config validation function now returns `Awaitable[list[str]]`.

- **`check_or_create_directory()` is now async**: Directory creation utility now returns `Awaitable[bool]`.

# Version 2026.1.18 (2026-01-08)

## What's Changed

### Added

- **Add `old_value` and `new_value` fields to `DataPointStateChangedEvent`**: External consumers can now track what changed without maintaining their own previous state. The fields are populated when values change and may be `None` during initial load or for non-value updates.

- **Add `AvailabilityInfo` dataclass**: New unified view of device availability bundling reachability, battery, and signal information:

  - `is_reachable`: Device reachability status (inverse of UNREACH)
  - `last_updated`: Most recent data point modification time
  - `battery_level`: Battery percentage (0-100) from OperatingVoltageLevel or BATTERY_STATE
  - `low_battery`: LOW_BAT indicator
  - `signal_strength`: RSSI in dBm from RSSI_DEVICE
  - Helper properties: `has_battery`, `has_signal_info`

- **Add `Device.availability` property**: Returns `AvailabilityInfo` providing a unified view of device connectivity and health status.

- **Add Consumer API documentation**: New `docs/consumer_api.md` guide explaining the three API layers (HomematicAPI, CentralUnit, Protocols), event subscription patterns, and common operations for external consumers like Matter bridges.

### Internal

- **Update `DeviceAvailabilityProtocol`**: Added `availability` property to the protocol interface
- **Update `CalculatedDataPointProtocol`**: Added missing `value` property to the protocol interface
- **Update `CallbackDataPointProtocol`**: Added `old_value` and `new_value` parameters to `publish_data_point_updated_event()`
- **Remove unnecessary delayed imports**: Moved `store.types` imports to top-level in 7 files and `metrics`/`central.events` imports in `request_coalescer.py`. These imports had `# noqa: PLC0415` markers but no actual circular dependency. Remaining delayed imports in `circuit_breaker.py` are necessary due to genuine circular dependency chains.

# Version 2026.1.17 (2026-01-07)

## What's Changed

### Internal

- **Extend DeviceDescription TypedDict to cover full API specification**: Activated all optional fields from HM_XmlRpc_API.pdf V2.16 and HMIP_XmlRpc_API_Addendum.pdf V2.10

  - **Added fields**: `PARENT_TYPE`, `RF_ADDRESS`, `INDEX`, `AES_ACTIVE`, `VERSION`, `FLAGS`, `DIRECTION`, `GROUP`, `TEAM`, `TEAM_TAG`, `TEAM_CHANNELS`, `ROAMING`
  - **Improved documentation**: Grouped fields by category (Common, Firmware, Interface/Connectivity, Links, Device metadata, Groups/Teams)
  - **Type safety**: Full type coverage for all fields defined in API specification

- **Improve ParameterData validation and type safety**:

  - **VALUE_LIST**: Changed from `Iterable[Any]` to `Iterable[str]` with validation ensuring all elements are converted to strings
  - **SPECIAL**: Documented actual usage pattern - API spec defines `Array<Struct>`, but CCU/pydevccu/Homegear return `Mapping[str, Any]` with special value IDs as keys (e.g., `{"NOT_USED": 111600.0, "PERMANENT": 255}`)
  - **Debug logging**: All validation failures now logged at DEBUG level with context (address, parameter name, validation error) for easier troubleshooting and backend compatibility monitoring

- **Implement ADR 0015: Description Data Normalization and Validation**: Establish comprehensive data normalization layer using voluptuous for device and parameter descriptions
  - **Problem**: Device descriptions and paramset descriptions were normalized at output points (e.g., `listDevices()` XML-RPC response), addressing symptoms rather than root causes. This violated DRY principle and created multiple validation points.
  - **Solution**: Normalize data at all ingestion points following "Parse, don't validate" pattern
  - **Benefits**: Single source of truth for data correctness, defense in depth with multiple validation points, cache efficiency through schema versioning, reduced complexity by eliminating output normalization

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix Homegear device details fetching in InterfaceClient**: The new `InterfaceClient` backend architecture was missing the `get_device_details()` implementation for Homegear
- **Fix excessive getValue calls during startup**: Fixed a bug where the data cache was expiring during device creation, causing hundreds of unnecessary getValue RPC calls

# Version 2026.1.16 (2026-01-06)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix VirtualDevices init() Timeout** (#2731): Fixed a bug where VirtualDevices init() times out even though the CCU successfully processed the request

  - **Root cause**: The VirtualDevices service on some CCU backends (OpenCCU, RaspberryMatic) processes the init() request correctly, calls back listDevices/newDevices, but fails to send the init() response. This causes a 3-second timeout even though the initialization was successful.

  - **Symptom**: `PROXY_INIT failed: NoConnectionException [OSError: timed out]` for VirtualDevices while BidCos-RF and HmIP-RF work fine. The CCU does call back `listDevices` successfully, but init() still times out.

  - **Fix**: Added detection of successful callback during init() timeout. If init() times out but a listDevices callback was received (indicated by `modified_at` timestamp update), the init() is treated as successful.

  - **Affected files**:

    - `aiohomematic/client/ccu.py`: Added callback detection in `init_proxy()`
    - `aiohomematic/client/interface_client.py`: Added callback detection in `init_proxy()`

  - **Impact**: VirtualDevices (heating groups) should now initialize reliably on OpenCCU/RaspberryMatic systems

# Version 2026.1.15 (2026-01-06)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix VirtualDevices Connection Failure** (#2731): Fixed a critical bug where VirtualDevices connections would fail with a 3-second timeout

  - **Root cause**: The CCU's Java `DeviceDescription.children` field expects `String[]` (array), but some backends (notably VirtualDevices) send `CHILDREN` as an empty string or omit it, causing the CCU's XML-RPC parser to crash with `IllegalArgumentException: Can not set String[] field to String`

  - **Fix**: Added `_normalize_device_description()` function that ensures `CHILDREN` is always a list before sending to the CCU via `listDevices` callback

  - **Affected files**:

    - `aiohomematic/central/rpc_server.py`: Added normalization for legacy XML-RPC server
    - `aiohomematic/central/async_rpc_server.py`: Added normalization for async XML-RPC server

  - **Impact**: VirtualDevices (heating groups) should now connect reliably on OpenCCU/RaspberryMatic systems

# Version 2026.1.14 (2026-01-06)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- **Remove Retry Logic for RPC Operations** (#2731): Completely removed the `@with_retry` decorator and `RetryStrategy` class from the codebase

  - **Rationale**: The retry mechanism (added in 2025.12.8) conflicted with the CircuitBreaker pattern, causing cascading failures. Each retry counted as a separate failure toward the circuit breaker threshold. On slow backends like VirtualDevices on Pi4/OpenCCU, this caused the circuit breaker to trip during initialization.

  - **What was removed**:

    - `aiohomematic/retry.py` module (RetryStrategy, with_retry, is_retryable_exception)
    - `@with_retry` decorator from `AioXmlRpcProxy`, `AioJsonRpcAioHttpClient`, and `HomematicAPI`
    - `RETRY_*` constants from `const.py`
    - `_RETRY_BYPASS_METHODS` constant from `rpc_proxy.py`

  - **Error handling preserved**: The existing mechanisms are sufficient:

    - `CircuitBreaker`: Fast-fail on backend outage (per-proxy)
    - `CentralConnectionState`: Aggregate health tracking (central)
    - `ClientStateMachine`: Connection lifecycle (per-client)
    - `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator`: Automatic reconnection (central)

  - **Impact**: Network errors now fail immediately instead of retrying. This provides more predictable behavior and prevents retry-induced failures. The ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator handles reconnection at the appropriate connection level.

  - **ADR**: See [ADR 0014](adr/0014-retry-logic-removal.md) for detailed rationale

# Version 2026.1.13 (2026-01-06)

## What's Changed

### Improvements

- **Add TypedDict for Device Details**: Introduced `DeviceDetail` and `ChannelDetail` TypedDicts for type-safe handling of JSON-RPC device details response

  - Provides static type checking via mypy
  - Better IDE autocomplete support
  - Documents the data structure in code

- **Rename Backend Methods for Consistency**: Renamed backend methods to follow consistent naming convention
  - `fetch_device_details()` → `get_device_details()` (returns data)
  - `fetch_all_device_data()` → `get_all_device_data()` (returns data)
  - Convention: `get_*` in BackendOperationsProtocol returns data, `fetch_*` in ClientProtocol fetches AND caches

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix InterfaceClient Not Loading Channel Names**: The `fetch_device_details()` method in InterfaceClient was not processing the nested `channels` array from the JSON-RPC response, causing channel names to be missing when using InterfaceClient instead of the legacy client

# Version 2026.1.12 (2026-01-06)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix Device Cache Not Reloading After Firmware Update**: The `updateDevice` callback now properly handles both firmware updates (hint=0) and link partner changes (hint=1)

  - **Root Cause**: The `updateDevice` callback was a NO-OP that only logged the event. The `hint` parameter (which indicates the type of update) was completely ignored
  - **Problem**: After a firmware update that changed a device's channel structure (e.g., HmIP-BRC2 removing channel 3), the cached descriptions still contained the old channel structure, causing errors like "Non-existent Channel 3". Link partner changes were also not propagated to the device model
  - **Fix**:
    - When `hint=0` (firmware update), the handler now:
      1. Removes cached device and paramset descriptions for the device
      2. Removes the Device object from the registry
      3. Fetches fresh device descriptions from the CCU
      4. Recreates the Device object with the new structure
    - When `hint=1` (link partner change), the handler now:
      1. Refreshes link peer information for all channels of the device
      2. Triggers `LinkPeerChangedEvent` if link peers have changed
  - **New Constant**: Added `UpdateDeviceHint` enum with `FIRMWARE=0` and `LINKS=1` values
  - **New Methods**:
    - `DeviceCoordinator.update_device()`: Handles firmware update cache invalidation
    - `DeviceCoordinator.refresh_device_link_peers()`: Handles link partner refresh

- **Implement Device Replacement Handler**: The `replaceDevice` callback now properly handles CCU device replacement

  - **Use Case**: When a broken device is replaced using the CCU's "Replace device" function, the CCU transfers configuration from the old to the new device and notifies listeners
  - **Previous Behavior**: Was a NO-OP that only logged the event
  - **New Behavior**:
    1. Removes the old device from registry and caches
    2. Fetches fresh device descriptions for the new device
    3. Creates the new Device object with all data points
  - **New Method**: `DeviceCoordinator.replace_device()`

- **Implement Re-Added Device Handler**: The `readdedDevice` callback now properly handles device re-pairing

  - **Use Case**: When a known device is put into learn-mode while installation mode is active (re-pairing), device parameters may have changed
  - **Previous Behavior**: Was a NO-OP that only logged the event
  - **New Behavior**:
    1. Removes cached descriptions to force refresh
    2. Fetches fresh device descriptions from the CCU
    3. Recreates the Device object with updated parameters
  - **New Method**: `DeviceCoordinator.readd_device()`

- **Fix Hub Entities Not Created When Secondary Clients Fail** (#2718): System variables, programs, and other hub entities are now created even when secondary clients (e.g., CUxD) fail to initialize

  - **Root Cause**: The `fetch_program_data()` and `fetch_sysvar_data()` methods checked `central.available`, which returns `False` if **any** client is unavailable
  - **Symptom**: When CUxD fails to connect, no programs or system variables appear in Home Assistant, showing "Entity no longer provided by integration"
  - **Fix**: Changed availability checks to use `primary_client.available` instead of `central.available`, since hub data is only fetched from the primary client (HmIP-RF/BidCoS-RF)
  - **Affected files**: `aiohomematic/model/hub/hub.py`, `aiohomematic/central/scheduler.py`

- **Fix Connection Recovery Port Detection for InterfaceClient**: The `_get_client_port()` method now correctly retrieves the port for both client implementations
  - **Root Cause**: The method only checked `client._config.interface_config.port` (ClientCCU path), but InterfaceClient stores config directly in `client._interface_config.port`
  - **Symptom**: Warning logged: `CONNECTION_RECOVERY: No port configured for <interface>, skipping TCP check`
  - **Fix**: Added check for `_interface_config` attribute first (InterfaceClient), then falls back to `_config.interface_config` (ClientCCU)

# Version 2026.1.11 (2026-01-05)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **New InterfaceClient with Backend Strategy Pattern**: Introduced a unified client implementation that replaces the three legacy clients (ClientCCU, ClientJsonCCU, ClientHomegear)

  - **Architecture**: Single `InterfaceClient` class delegates transport operations to backend strategies (CcuBackend, JsonCcuBackend, HomegearBackend)
  - **Benefits**: Cleaner separation of concerns, easier maintenance, consistent behavior across all backend types
  - **Feature Flag**: Enable via `OptionalSettings.USE_INTERFACE_CLIENT` or environment variable `AIOHOMEMATIC_USE_INTERFACE_CLIENT=1`
  - **Status**: Phase 2 complete - all business logic migrated, 24 comparison tests verify identical behavior to legacy clients
  - **Documentation**: See `docs/adr/0013-implementation-status.md` for implementation details

- **CI Tests Both Client Implementations**: The CI pipeline now runs the full test suite (1640 tests) with both legacy client and InterfaceClient implementations
  - Test infrastructure updated to support InterfaceClient's `__slots__` architecture
  - Coverage threshold temporarily lowered to 80% (will be restored to 85% after legacy client cleanup)

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix VirtualDevices Init Timeout Causing Client Failure**: The `init()` RPC method is now excluded from automatic retry logic

  - **Root Cause**: In version 2025.12.8, `@with_retry` was added to XML-RPC requests, causing `init()` failures to trigger 3 retry attempts before marking the client as FAILED
  - **Problem**: VirtualDevices interface on some CCUs doesn't respond to `init()` within the timeout, but sends the `listDevices` callback correctly. The retry mechanism amplified single timeouts into complete client failure
  - **Fix**: Added `_RETRY_BYPASS_METHODS` constant excluding `init` from retry logic. The client state machine handles `init` failures via its own reconnection logic
  - **Impact**: VirtualDevices (heating groups) connections are more resilient on slow-responding CCUs

- **Fix HmIP-MP3P LED Auto-Off After 10 Seconds**: The sound player LED (`light.turn_on`) now stays on permanently by default instead of turning off after 10 seconds

  - Changed the default `on_time` from `10.0` to `0.0` (permanently on)
  - Previously, calling `light.turn_on` without explicit `on_time` would send `DURATION_VALUE: 10`, causing the LED to turn off after 10 seconds even though `ON_TIME_LIST: PERMANENTLY_ON` was also sent

- **Fix Device Availability Not Updating in Home Assistant**: Entities on channels other than `:0` now properly update their availability state when `UN_REACH` or `STICKY_UN_REACH` changes

  - **Root Cause**: When `UN_REACH` changed on channel `:0`, only `publish_device_updated_event()` was called. Entities subscribe to their own data point's `subscribe_to_data_point_updated`, not to device events
  - **Problem**: Entities on channels `:1`, `:2`, etc. never received notification of availability changes and continued showing cached "available" state
  - **Fix**: Now notifies all data points on the device via `publish_data_point_updated_event()` when availability changes, similar to `set_forced_availability()`

- **Fix InterfaceClient Ping-Pong Token Handling**: The new InterfaceClient now correctly passes the ping-pong token through backend strategies
  - Token is now passed from `InterfaceClient.ping()` to the backend's `ping()` method
  - Ensures proper connection health monitoring with the new client implementation

### Internal

- **Replace `supports_*` Methods with `capabilities` Object**: Consolidated 10 boolean `supports_*` properties into a single `ClientCapabilities` dataclass

  - **Before**: `client.supports_ping`, `client.supports_programs`, `client.supports_install_mode`, etc.
  - **After**: `client.capabilities.supports_ping`, `client.capabilities.supports_programs`, etc.
  - Capabilities are determined once at client creation based on backend type
  - Removes ~300 lines of redundant property definitions across client classes
  - Both legacy clients and InterfaceClient now use the same capabilities system

- **InterfaceClient Feature Parity**: Added missing methods to achieve full feature parity with legacy clients
  - Added `is_callback_alive()`, `check_connection_availability()`, `execute_program()`, `set_system_variable()`, `get_system_variable()`, and 8 other methods
  - InterfaceClient now implements all 45+ methods from the client protocol

# Version 2026.1.10 (2026-01-04)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix CUxD/CCU-Jack Recovery for JSON-RPC-only Interfaces**: Connection recovery now properly handles JSON-RPC-only interfaces (CUxD, CCU-Jack)
  - **TCP Check**: For interfaces without an XML-RPC port (port=0), the recovery now checks the JSON-RPC port (80/443) instead of failing immediately
  - **RPC Availability Check**: JSON-RPC-only interfaces now use `check_connection_availability()` (which calls `Interface.isPresent` via JSON-RPC) instead of attempting XML-RPC `system.listMethods`
  - Previously, CUxD recovery would always fail at the TCP check stage because `_get_client_port` returned `None`
  - This caused the central to enter FAILED state after max retries even when the CUxD service was available

---

# Version 2026.1.9 (2026-01-04)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Backend Detection Validates Interface Availability**: The backend detection now verifies that each interface process is actually running via `is_present()` check, not just installed

  - Previously, interfaces like CUxD would be reported as "available" even when the daemon wasn't running
  - This caused connection recovery loops and eventual "central failed" state when the integration tried to connect to non-running interfaces
  - Now only interfaces that pass the `is_present()` check are included in the detection result
  - Added warning logs when installed interfaces are not running

- **Fix CUxD/CCU-Jack JSON-RPC Method Overrides**: `ClientJsonCCU` now properly uses JSON-RPC for all device operations
  - Fixed `UnsupportedException` errors for `getParamsetDescription` and related methods
  - Added missing method overrides: `fetch_paramset_description`, `fetch_paramset_descriptions`, `get_paramset_descriptions`, `get_all_paramset_descriptions`, `get_all_device_descriptions`, `update_paramset_descriptions`
  - These methods were previously delegating to the handler which used XML-RPC (not available for CUxD/CCU-Jack interfaces)

### Improvements

- **Dynamic Version Detection in Issue Analyzer**: The GitHub Issue Analyzer bot now fetches current integration versions dynamically from GitHub Releases instead of using outdated hardcoded values
  - Fixes incorrect "outdated version" warnings when users report issues with the latest version
  - Supports automatic version detection for stable and pre-release versions
  - No longer requires manual updates to the analyzer script when new versions are released
  - If version information cannot be retrieved, no version-related comments are made

---

# Version 2026.1.8 (2026-01-03)

## What's Changed

### Improvements

- **Reduce RPC Error Log Noise**: Expected RPC errors during initial data loading no longer clutter the logs

  - Added `_XmlRpcFaultCode` enum documenting all Homematic XML-RPC error codes (-1 to -10)
  - Expected errors (Unknown Parameter, UNREACH, Unknown Device, etc.) now recorded with WARNING severity
  - Incident Store always logs at DEBUG level - its purpose is recording, not active logging
  - Active logging remains at the source (`log_boundary_error`, `@inspector` decorator)
  - Eliminates duplicate logging between Incident Store and boundary error handlers

- **Increase Incident Store Capacity**: Raised `INCIDENT_STORE_MAX_PER_TYPE` from 20 to 50 for better diagnostics

---

# Version 2026.1.7 (2026-01-03)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix Runtime Device Addition**: Fixed `KeyError` when adding new devices during runtime after cache was loaded
  - Root cause: `ParamsetDescriptionRegistry` lost its nested `defaultdict` structure after loading from JSON
  - When a new device was added, accessing non-existent keys raised `KeyError` instead of creating empty dicts
  - Error manifested as: `UPDATE_CACHES_WITH_NEW_DEVICES failed: KeyError [device_address]`
  - Fix rebuilds proper `defaultdict` structure in `_process_loaded_content()`
  - Added regression test for the scenario

### Internal

- **Remove asyncio Fallbacks**: Made `task_scheduler` a required parameter in core infrastructure classes

  - `EventBus`, `CircuitBreaker`, and `Storage` now require explicit `TaskSchedulerProtocol` injection
  - Removes runtime asyncio event loop fallback code that was only used in tests
  - Improves code clarity and ensures consistent dependency injection patterns
  - Test infrastructure updated with `_NoOpTaskScheduler` for synchronous tests

- **Remove Legacy Code**: Removed `regular_to_default_dict_hook` from `support.py`
  - This function was used with `json.loads(object_hook=...)` before Storage Abstraction Layer
  - No longer needed since `orjson` doesn't support object_hook parameter

---

# Version 2026.1.6 (2026-01-03)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix CuXD/CCU-Jack Device Control**: `ClientJsonCCU` now properly overrides `set_value` and `put_paramset` to use JSON-RPC

  - Root cause: After handler refactoring (#2554), `DeviceHandler` used XML-RPC proxy for all value operations
  - `ClientJsonCCU` used `NullRpcProxy` which threw `UnsupportedException` for all RPC calls
  - CuXD and CCU-Jack devices could not be controlled (set_value failed silently)
  - Fix restores the JSON-RPC based value operations that worked in version 2025.11.7
  - Added tests to verify `ClientJsonCCU` uses JSON-RPC for `set_value` and `put_paramset`

- **Fix Sysvar-to-Device Association**: System variables with device references are now correctly associated with their devices/channels
  - Root cause: After coordinator refactoring, hub initialization happened BEFORE device creation
  - `identify_channel()` found no channels because devices didn't exist yet during sysvar creation
  - Fix: Device creation now happens BEFORE hub initialization in `start_clients()`
  - Sysvars containing channel/device ise_ids are now properly linked to their devices in Home Assistant

### New Features

- **Circuit Breaker Incident Recording**: Circuit breaker state changes are now recorded as incidents

  - `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_TRIPPED` (ERROR): When circuit breaker opens due to excessive failures
  - `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERED` (INFO): When circuit breaker recovers after successful test requests
  - Incidents include comprehensive context: failure/success counts, thresholds, timestamps, total requests

- **CONNECTION_LOST Incident Recording**: Connection loss events are now recorded as incidents

  - `CONNECTION_LOST` (ERROR): When connection to backend is lost
  - Recorded by `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator` when handling connection loss events
  - Context includes: reason, client state, circuit breaker state, recovery attempt count, active recoveries

- **CONNECTION_RESTORED Incident Recording**: Connection restoration events are now recorded as incidents

  - `CONNECTION_RESTORED` (INFO): When connection to backend is successfully restored
  - Recorded by `ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator` after successful recovery completion
  - Context includes: total attempts, duration, stages completed, client state, circuit breaker state

- **RPC_ERROR Incident Recording**: RPC call failures are now recorded as incidents

  - `RPC_ERROR` (ERROR): When an RPC call fails (SSL, OS, protocol, or general errors)
  - Recorded by both `AioXmlRpcProxy` (XML-RPC) and `AioJsonRpcAioHttpClient` (JSON-RPC)
  - Context includes: protocol, method, error type, sanitized error message, TLS status
  - Supports all error types: SSLError, OSError, XMLRPCFault, ProtocolError, JSONRPCError, etc.

- **CALLBACK_TIMEOUT Incident Recording**: Callback timeout events are now recorded as incidents

  - `CALLBACK_TIMEOUT` (WARNING): When no callback is received from backend within configured interval
  - Recorded by `ClientCCU` when callback staleness is detected in `is_callback_alive()`
  - Context includes: seconds since last event, configured threshold, last event time, client/circuit breaker state

- **Per-Type Incident Storage**: IncidentStore now uses per-IncidentType storage limits
  - Each incident type maintains its own history (max 20 per type, 7-day retention)
  - Prevents high-frequency incidents from crowding out rare but important events
  - Renamed `max_incidents` to `max_per_type` parameter

---

# Version 2026.1.5 (2026-01-02)

## What's Changed

- **Add IncidentStore for Persistent Diagnostic Incidents**: New storage system for tracking and persisting diagnostic incidents

  - Introduces `IncidentStore` in `aiohomematic/store/persistent/incident.py`
  - Implements save-on-incident, load-on-demand persistence strategy
  - Stores incidents in `{storage_path}/cache/{central_name}_hm_incidents.json`
  - Automatic cleanup of old incidents (default: 7 days retention)
  - Incidents are deleted when integration is removed via `cleanup_files()`

- **PingPong Tracker Incident Recording**: Connection health issues are now recorded as incidents

  - `PING_PONG_MISMATCH_HIGH` (ERROR): When pending PONG count exceeds threshold
  - `PING_PONG_UNKNOWN_HIGH` (WARNING): When unknown PONG count exceeds threshold
  - Incidents include context (counts, thresholds) and journal excerpts for debugging
  - Added `IncidentRecorderProtocol` for decoupled incident recording

- **PingPong Diagnostics Journal**: Enhanced diagnostic capabilities for connection monitoring
  - `PingPongJournal` ring buffer tracks PING/PONG events with timestamps
  - RTT (round-trip time) statistics available via `get_rtt_statistics()`
  - Journal excerpts attached to incidents for post-mortem analysis

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix KeyError for PARENT in Device Descriptions**: Use `.get()` to safely access optional `PARENT` field

  - Some device descriptions may not include the `PARENT` key
  - Fixes `KeyError: 'PARENT'` during device discovery

- **Fix KeyError for CHILDREN in Device Descriptions**: Use `.get()` to safely access optional `CHILDREN` field
  - Affected files: `model/device.py`, `client/handlers/device_ops.py`, `store/persistent/device.py`
  - Prevents `KeyError: 'CHILDREN'` for devices without channel children

---

# Version 2026.1.4 (2026-01-02)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix PingPong Unknown Issue Not Cleared**: Unknown PONG mismatch issues are now properly cleared when conditions normalize

  - Previously, when unknown PONGs exceeded the threshold (15), a repair issue was created but never removed
  - Now a reset event (`mismatch_count=0`) is published when the count drops below the threshold
  - Matches the existing behavior for pending PING mismatches

- **Fix OperatingVoltageLevel Shows Unknown After Restart** (Issue #2674): Battery parameters now load from cache on startup
  - Previously, parameters with `ignore_on_initial_load=True` (e.g., `OPERATING_VOLTAGE`, `LOW_BAT`) would remain "Unknown" after HA restart until the device was triggered
  - Now these parameters load from the persistent data cache while still skipping RPC calls to avoid waking battery devices
  - Calculated data points like `OperatingVoltageLevel` now show their cached values immediately after restart

---

# Version 2026.1.3 (2026-01-02)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix PingPong Race Condition**: Register ping token in tracker _before_ sending the ping request

  - Previously, the CCU could respond with PONG before the token was registered, causing false "unknown PONG" counts
  - Now the token is tracked before `await proxy.ping()`, eliminating the race condition

- **Fix Week Profile ScheduleCondition**: Extended `ScheduleCondition` enum with all 8 valid values

  - Added: `FIXED_IF_BEFORE_ASTRO`, `ASTRO_IF_BEFORE_FIXED`, `FIXED_IF_AFTER_ASTRO`, `ASTRO_IF_AFTER_FIXED`, `EARLIEST_OF_FIXED_AND_ASTRO`, `LATEST_OF_FIXED_AND_ASTRO`
  - Fixes `ValueError: 7 is not a valid ScheduleCondition` on HmIP-BROLL blinds with astro-based schedules
  - Added graceful fallback for unknown enum values in `AstroType`, `TimeBase`, and `ScheduleCondition`

- **Fix ClientJsonCCU Handler Initialization**: `ClientJsonCCU` (used for CCU-Jack) now properly initializes handlers
  - Root cause: `init_client()` only initialized handlers when `supports_rpc_callback=True`, but CCU-Jack uses JSON-RPC exclusively
  - Added `NullRpcProxy` class - a lightweight proxy placeholder that doesn't create XML-RPC connections
  - `ClientJsonCCU.init_client()` now uses `NullRpcProxy` to satisfy handler initialization without wasting resources
  - Fixes `AttributeError: 'ClientJsonCCU' object has no attribute '_device_ops_handler'`

---

# Version 2026.1.2 (2026-01-01)

## What's Changed

### Refactoring

- **Async DNS Resolution**: `get_ip_addr()` now uses async `loop.getaddrinfo()` instead of blocking `socket.gethostbyname()`

  - Eliminates need for executor thread pool for DNS lookups
  - Direct `await` instead of `async_add_executor_job()` wrapper

- **Removed Dead Code**: Removed unused `shrink_json_file()` function from `support.py`

---

# Version 2026.1.1 (2026-01-01)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **RPC Server Metrics**: New `rpc_server` section in metrics aggregation

  - Tracks incoming requests from CCU to the XML-RPC callback server
  - `RpcServerMetrics` dataclass with: `total_requests`, `total_errors`, `active_tasks`, `avg_latency_ms`, `max_latency_ms`
  - Computed properties: `error_rate`, `success_rate`
  - Available via `MetricsAggregator.rpc_server` and included in `MetricsSnapshot`

- **Generic Metrics Serialization**: `MetricsSnapshot.to_dict()` method for JSON-serializable output

  - Automatically converts all fields and computed `@property` values
  - Handles datetime → ISO format, float → rounded to 2 decimals, nested dataclasses → recursive conversion
  - Eliminates manual field mapping in diagnostics code

- **Generic Health Serialization**: `CentralHealth.to_dict()` and `ConnectionHealth.to_dict()` methods

  - Same generic conversion as metrics: fields, properties, datetime, Enum → name
  - Nested `client_health` dict with per-client status automatically converted
  - Simplifies diagnostics and monitoring integration

- **Data Points by Category**: New `ModelMetrics.data_points_by_category` field

  - Counts all data points grouped by `DataPointCategory` (SWITCH, SENSOR, CLIMATE, etc.)
  - Includes device data points, program data points, and sysvar data points
  - Available via `MetricsAggregator.model.data_points_by_category` and in `MetricsSnapshot`
  - Replaces manual counting logic in diagnostics code

- **Complete Cache Metrics**: Full cache statistics in `CacheMetrics`
  - New `SizeOnlyStats` for registries/trackers (size only, no hit/miss semantics)
  - `CacheStats` reserved for true caches with hit/miss/eviction tracking
  - Registries: `device_descriptions`, `paramset_descriptions`, `visibility_registry` (size only)
  - Trackers: `ping_pong_tracker`, `command_tracker` (size and evictions only)
  - True caches: `data_cache` (size, hits, misses, evictions)
  - New `CacheProviderForMetricsProtocol` for centralized cache access

### Bug Fixes

- **Race Condition in Device Creation**: Fixed race condition between newDevices callback and startup code

  - Root cause: Startup code called `check_for_new_device_addresses()` while callback was still populating cache
  - Device creation now happens inside semaphore in `_add_new_devices()` to ensure all descriptions are cached first
  - New `check_and_create_devices_from_cache()` method for atomic check-and-create with semaphore protection
  - Startup code now uses atomic method to prevent racing with callbacks

- **Resilient Device Creation**: Device creation no longer crashes when channel descriptions are missing
  - New `DescriptionNotFoundException` for specific error handling
  - `Device.__init__` gracefully skips channels with missing descriptions and logs a warning
  - Device remains functional with available channels

### Refactoring

- **Semantic Class Naming**: Renamed classes to better reflect their actual purpose
  - `CommandCache` → `CommandTracker` (tracks sent commands, no hit/miss semantics)
  - `PingPongCache` → `PingPongTracker` (tracks connection health, not a cache)
  - `DeviceDescriptionCache` → `DeviceDescriptionRegistry` (authoritative store, not a cache)
  - `ParamsetDescriptionCache` → `ParamsetDescriptionRegistry` (authoritative store, not a cache)
  - `ParameterVisibilityCache` → `ParameterVisibilityRegistry` (defines rules, memoization is implementation detail)
  - `last_value_send_cache` → `last_value_send_tracker` property on clients
  - `CacheName` enum reduced to `DATA` only (the actual cache with hit/miss semantics)
  - New `TrackerStatistics` for tracker-specific stats (evictions only, no hits/misses)
  - Removed `CacheStatistics` from `ParameterVisibilityRegistry` (deterministic rules don't need hit/miss tracking)

---

  - `CentralConfig.storage_factory` field for dependency injection
  - `cleanup_files()` method for deleting all storage files
  - Configurable storage options: `raw_mode` (no metadata wrapper), `formatted` (indented JSON), `as_zip` (ZIP compression)

- **Device Definition Export**: Single ZIP file export for device definitions
  - `_DefinitionExporter` now creates `{model}.zip` containing subdirectories
  - `device_descriptions/{model}.json` and `paramset_descriptions/{model}.json` inside ZIP
  - Formatted JSON output with indentation for readability

### Code Quality

# Version 2025.12.55 (2025-12-30)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **Fixed Color Light API**: Expose fixed color utilities as public API for Home Assistant integration
  - `FixedColor` enum (previously `_FixedColor`) - available color names (WHITE, RED, YELLOW, etc.)
  - `FIXED_COLOR_TO_HS` mapping (previously `_FIXED_COLOR_SWITCHER`) - converts fixed colors to HS values
  - `hs_color_to_fixed_converter()` function (previously `_convert_color()`) - converts HS color to nearest fixed color

### Code Quality

- **Package Structure Refactoring**: Improved maintainability by splitting large `__init__.py` files

  - `client/__init__.py` (1793 → 105 lines): Moved client classes to dedicated modules
    - `client/ccu.py`: `ClientCCU`, `ClientJsonCCU`, `ClientHomegear`, `ClientConfig`
    - `client/config.py`: `InterfaceConfig`
  - `model/hub/__init__.py` (803 → 123 lines): Moved Hub class to dedicated module
    - `model/hub/hub.py`: `Hub`, `ProgramDpType`, `MetricsDpType`
  - All public APIs remain unchanged (re-exported from `__init__.py`)
  - Fixed circular imports by using direct submodule imports in `metrics/aggregator.py` and `client/rpc_proxy.py`

- **Export Validation**: New linter script for validating `__all__` exports

  - `script/lint_all_exports.py`: Validates exports are imported, grouped, and sorted
  - Ensures consistency across all package `__init__.py` files

- **Import Standardization**: Enforce consistent package import conventions across the codebase
  - External consumers (tests, `aiohomematic_test_support`) must import public symbols from package `__init__.py` facades, not directly from submodules
  - Example: `from aiohomematic.interfaces import ChannelProtocol` instead of `from aiohomematic.interfaces.model import ChannelProtocol`
  - Added `callback_backend_system` and `callback_event` decorators to `aiohomematic.central` public API
  - New pre-commit hook `lint-package-imports` enforces these conventions
  - New linter script `script/lint_package_imports.py` with `--all` flag for checking internal imports

# Version 2025.12.54 (2025-12-29)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **ConnectionRecoveryCoordinator**: Fixed JSON-RPC authentication failures during connection recovery

  - Added `clear_json_rpc_session()` method to `Client` class
  - Session is now cleared at recovery start to force re-authentication
  - Prevents "access denied" errors when CCU restarts and invalidates existing sessions

- **HubCoordinator**: Fixed inbox data not being fetched during initialization

  - `init_hub()` now calls `fetch_inbox_data(scheduled=False)` alongside program/sysvar data
  - This ensures the inbox sensor is created at startup and HA receives the `HUB_REFRESHED` event
  - Previously, inbox data was only fetched by the scheduler after `sys_scan_interval`

- **EventCoordinator**: Fixed `DEVICES_DELAYED` event not being forwarded to integrations
  - Added `DeviceLifecycleEventType.DELAYED` to the enum
  - Added `interface_id` field to `DeviceLifecycleEvent` for repair issue context
  - Added handler in `publish_system_event()` to emit `DeviceLifecycleEvent` with `DELAYED` type
  - This restores the repair issue flow for delayed device creation (broken since event migration in 2025.12.27)

### New Features

  - Located in `aiohomematic/central/connection_recovery.py`
  - Replaces `SelfHealingCoordinator`, `RecoveryCoordinator`, and `BackgroundScheduler` recovery logic

  - **Staged Recovery Process**: TCP check → RPC check → Warmup → Stability check → Reconnect → Data load
  - **Retry Management**: Exponential backoff with max 8 attempts, heartbeat retry in FAILED state
  - **Parallel Recovery**: Throttled parallel recovery with semaphore (max 2 concurrent)
  - **New Recovery Events**:
    - `ConnectionLostEvent`: Emitted when connection is lost
    - `RecoveryStageChangedEvent`: Tracks recovery stage transitions
    - `RecoveryAttemptedEvent`: Records each recovery attempt
    - `RecoveryCompletedEvent`: Emitted on successful recovery
    - `RecoveryFailedEvent`: Emitted when max retries reached

  - `aiohomematic/metrics/service.py`
- **Removed deprecated exports from `aiohomematic.metrics`**: `record_service_call`, `get_service_stats`, `clear_service_stats`
- **BaseParameterDataPoint**: Renamed `previous_value` to `last_non_default_value` with changed semantics
  - Now stores only meaningful (non-default) values instead of the immediate previous value
  - Enables "restore last brightness" feature for dimmers - stores last non-zero level
  - Hub data points (sysvar, metrics, inbox) use separate caching for refresh/modify detection
- **Event Naming Improvements**: Renamed events for better clarity and self-documentation
  - `BackendParameterEvent` → `RpcParameterReceivedEvent` (raw parameter from RPC callback)
  - `DataPointUpdatedEvent` → `DataPointValueReceivedEvent` (data point value received from backend)
  - `DataPointStatusUpdatedEvent` → `DataPointStatusReceivedEvent` (status parameter received from backend)
  - `DataPointUpdatedCallbackEvent` → `DataPointStateChangedEvent` (callback for state changes)
  - `SysvarUpdatedEvent` → `SysvarStateChangedEvent` (system variable state changed)
  - `DeviceUpdatedEvent` → `DeviceStateChangedEvent` (device state changed)
  - `FirmwareUpdatedEvent` → `FirmwareStateChangedEvent` (firmware state changed)
  - `ConnectionStageEvent` → `ConnectionStageChangedEvent` (connection stage changed)
  - `ConnectionHealthEvent` → `ConnectionHealthChangedEvent` (connection health changed)

# Version 2025.12.52 (2025-12-27)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix health score not reaching 100%**: JSON-RPC client was using URL instead of interface_id for health tracking, causing `last_successful_request` to never be recorded. Now uses primary client's interface_id for proper health attribution.
- **Fix `HealthMetrics.last_event_time` always showing epoch**: The `last_event_time` field was never populated in `MetricsAggregator.health`. Now correctly aggregates the most recent event time across all clients.
- **Fix connection latency always showing 0.0 ms**: `latency_tracker` only tracked paramset description requests which rarely executed. Now uses ping/pong round-trip time for accurate latency measurement via `PingPongCache.latency_stats`.
- **Fix test mock returning `_Method` instead of `CircuitBreakerMetrics`**: Added proper `circuit_breaker` property to `_AioXmlRpcProxyFromSession` mock to return real `CircuitBreaker` instance.

  - Automatic conversion to device VALUE_LIST strings (REPETITIONS_XXX format)
- **HmIP-MP3P**: Remove `available_repetitions` property (no longer needed with int-based API)

### Internal

- **ProfileConfig**: Add `fixed_channel_fields` / `visible_fixed_channel_fields` to `ChannelGroupConfig`
  - Allows defining fields with absolute channel numbers (not rebased relative to group_no)
  - Useful for device-wide parameters on channel 0

  - Enhanced AST visitor to detect `DelegatedProperty` in annotated assignments (e.g., `name: Final = DelegatedProperty[...]`)
  - Enhanced AST visitor to detect `@hm_property(cached=True)` and similar decorators
  - Tracks class-level plain assignments (e.g., `_enabled_default = True`)
  - Validates path resolution and cache slots across class inheritance hierarchy

- **Replace `IN_SERVICE_VAR` with `RequestContext`**: Unified service call tracking through the new context variables pattern

  - Removed standalone `IN_SERVICE_VAR: ContextVar[bool]` in favor of `RequestContext`
  - Added `is_in_service()` helper that checks for `operation.startswith("service:")`
  - `@inspector` decorator now creates `RequestContext(operation="service:{func_name}")` for service calls
  - `@bind_collector` decorator uses the same pattern for consistent context propagation
  - Breaking: `IN_SERVICE_VAR` is no longer exported from `aiohomematic.context`

- **Add `CentralConfigBuilder` for fluent configuration**: Implement Builder Pattern for `CentralConfig` with step-by-step configuration and validation

  - `CentralConfigBuilder` class with fluent method chaining (`.with_name()`, `.with_host()`, `.add_hmip_interface()`, etc.)
  - Factory presets: `CentralConfigBuilder.for_ccu()` and `CentralConfigBuilder.for_homegear()`
  - Early validation via `.validate()` method returning list of `ValidationError`
  - Automatic interface port resolution based on TLS settings
  - 36 tests covering all builder functionality

- **Introduce singledispatch pattern for type converters**: Added extensible type conversion using Python's `functools.singledispatch`

  - New `to_homematic_value()` converter: Python types → Homematic-compatible values (bool→int, float→rounded, datetime→ISO, timedelta→seconds, Enum→value, list/dict→recursive)
  - New `from_homematic_value()` converter: Homematic values → Python types with optional target_type hints
  - Refactored `_get_text_value()` in property_decorators.py to use singledispatch
  - Both converters are extensible via `@converter.register(YourType)`

- **Make data point protocols generic for improved type safety**: Protocols now preserve generic type information for mypy

  - `BaseParameterDataPointProtocol[ParameterT]` - properties like `default`, `max`, `min`, `previous_value`, `value` now return `ParameterT` instead of `Any`
  - `GenericDataPointProtocol[ParameterT]` - extends base protocol with typed value handling
  - Added type aliases for heterogeneous collections: `BaseParameterDataPointProtocolAny`, `GenericDataPointProtocolAny`, `GenericEventProtocolAny`

- **Fix property decorators to preserve generic type information for mypy**: The `value` property on data points now correctly infers types (e.g., `DpSwitch.value` → `bool | None`, `DpSensor[float].value` → `float | None`)

  - Changed `BaseParameterDataPoint.value` from `@state_property` decorator to explicit `_GenericProperty` construction with `kind=Kind.STATE`
  - Added `__get__` overloads to `_GenericProperty` for proper type inference
  - Exported `Kind` and `_GenericProperty` from `property_decorators.py`
  - Subclasses override `_get_value()` method for custom value reading logic

- **Refactor `CustomDataPoint` to use `DataPointField` descriptor**: Declarative field definitions replace imperative `_init_data_point_fields()`

  - `DataPointField` now uses keyword-only `__init__` parameters
  - Eliminated `_init_data_point_fields()` method from `CustomDataPoint` base class
  - Applied `DataPointField` pattern to all custom data point classes (climate, cover, light, lock, siren, switch, valve)
  - Subclasses use `_post_init()` for additional initialization after field resolution

- **Add `CalculatedDataPointField` descriptor for calculated data points**: Mirrors the `DataPointField` descriptor pattern from custom data points

  - New file `aiohomematic/model/calculated/field.py` with `CalculatedDataPointField` descriptor
  - Changed `CalculatedDataPoint._data_points` from `list` to `dict` for O(1) lookup by `(parameter, paramset_key)` key
  - Added `_resolve_data_point()` method for lazy data point resolution with subscription handling
  - Added `fallback_parameters` support for trying alternative parameters (e.g., `TEMPERATURE` → `ACTUAL_TEMPERATURE`)
  - Added `use_device_fallback` support for trying device address (channel 0) if not found on current channel
  - Refactored `BaseClimateSensor`, `ApparentTemperature`, and `OperatingVoltageLevel` to use declarative field descriptors

- **Optimize field descriptors**: Removed unused `_attr_name` slot and `__set_name__` method from `DataPointField` and `CalculatedDataPointField`

- **Require explicit cache slots for cached properties**: Removed `WeakKeyDictionary` fallback from both `@hm_property(cached=True)` and `DelegatedProperty(cached=True)` in favor of explicit slot definitions

  - Both decorators now validate at class-definition time that `_cached_{property_name}` exists in `__slots__`
  - `TypeError` is raised immediately when class is defined if cache slot is missing (not at runtime)
  - Added cache slots to `Channel` (`_cached_group_master`, `_cached_group_no`, `_cached_is_in_multi_group`)
  - Added cache slot to `CalculatedDataPoint` (`_cached_dpk`)
  - DP005 linter rule validates cache slots exist (see lint-delegated-property changes above)
  - Breaking: Classes that previously relied on `WeakKeyDictionary` fallback must add explicit slots

- **Add `DelegatedProperty` descriptor**: New descriptor for delegating property access to nested attribute paths
  - Supports `kind` (config/info/state/simple) for categorization via `get_hm_property_by_kind()`
  - Supports `cached=True` for per-instance caching of delegated values (requires explicit `_cached_{name}` slot)
  - Supports `log_context=True` for structured logging
  - Migrated 266 simple delegation properties across the codebase to use `DelegatedProperty`
  - Note: Cannot be used when subclasses override with `@property` due to mypy limitations

# Version 2025.12.43 (2025-12-22)

## What's Changed

### Improvements

- **Make `ACOUSTIC_ALARM_SELECTION` and `OPTICAL_ALARM_SELECTION` visible**: These siren parameters are now exposed as entities
- **Enhance `siren.turn_on` service**: Now uses values from `ACOUSTIC_ALARM_SELECTION` and `OPTICAL_ALARM_SELECTION` entities as fallback when not provided in service call
- **`DpActionSelect` value setter uses `write_value`**: Keeps history clean and fires update events when value is set

# Version 2025.12.42 (2025-12-21)

## What's Changed

### New Features

- **Introduce `DpActionSelect` data point type**: New category for write-only ENUM parameters with VALUE_LIST
  - Provides a `value` getter to read the current selection (unlike `DpAction` which is write-only)
  - Automatically created by factory for write-only parameters with VALUE_LIST
  - New category: `DataPointCategory.ACTION_SELECT`
  - Located in `aiohomematic/model/generic/action_select.py`

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix custom data point type annotations**: Verified all custom data point types against pydevccu paramset descriptions

  - **cover.py**: Changed `_dp_section` from `DpSensor[str | None]` to `DpSensor[int | None]` (SECTION is INTEGER 0-15, not STRING)

- **Update custom data points to use `DpActionSelect`**: Parameters with VALUE_LIST now correctly use `DpActionSelect` instead of `DpAction`
  - **siren.py**: `ACOUSTIC_ALARM_SELECTION`, `OPTICAL_ALARM_SELECTION`, `DURATION_UNIT`, `SMOKE_DETECTOR_COMMAND`
  - **lock.py**: `LOCK_TARGET_LEVEL`
  - **light.py**: `ON_TIME_UNIT`, `EFFECT`, `RAMP_TIME_TO_OFF_UNIT`, `RAMP_TIME_UNIT`

  - `EventType` → `DeviceTriggerEventType` in `aiohomematic.const`
  - Affects: `DEVICE_ERROR`, `IMPULSE`, `KEYPRESS` event types
  - Update imports: `from aiohomematic.const import DeviceTriggerEventType`

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix `update_status` to accept integer values from backend**: Backend sends integer indices for STATUS parameters
  - `update_status` now accepts both `int` (backend index) and `str` (enum value)
  - Integer indices are converted to strings using the cached VALUE_LIST from the status parameter's paramset description
  - This ensures correct mapping regardless of `ParameterStatus` enum order
  - `DataPointStatusReceivedEvent.status_value` type is `int | str`

# Version 2025.12.40 (2025-12-20)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Change `ParameterStatus` from `IntEnum` to `StrEnum`**: Align enum with actual HmIP parameter values

  - `DataPointStatusReceivedEvent.status_value` type changed to `str`

# Version 2025.12.38 (2025-12-20)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- **Fix ENUM parameter handling for HmIP devices**: Properly detect and handle string-based ENUMs vs index-based ENUMs
  - **Root cause**: HM devices use integer MIN/MAX/DEFAULT for ENUMs (send as index), while HmIP devices use string MIN/MAX/DEFAULT (send as string value)
  - Added `_enum_value_is_index` detection based on `isinstance(MIN, int)` in `BaseParameterDataPoint`
  - Updated `DpAction` and `DpSelect` to send string values for HmIP devices
  - Affects all ENUM parameters on HmIP devices including:
    - Time units: `RAMP_TIME_UNIT`, `DURATION_UNIT`, `ON_TIME_UNIT` (now "S", "M", "H" instead of 0, 1, 2)
    - Lock commands: `LOCK_TARGET_LEVEL` (now "LOCKED", "UNLOCKED", "OPEN")
    - Garage commands: `DOOR_COMMAND` (now "OPEN", "CLOSE", "STOP", "PARTIAL_OPEN")
    - Siren alarms: `ACOUSTIC_ALARM_SELECTION`, `OPTICAL_ALARM_SELECTION`, `SMOKE_DETECTOR_COMMAND`
    - Light effects: `COLOR`, `COLOR_BEHAVIOUR`
  - Resolves issues with HmIP-RGBW, HmIP-LSC, HmIP-BSL, HmIP-DRG-DALI, HmIPW-WRC6, and other HmIP devices

# Version 2025.12.37 (2025-12-19)

## What's Changed

### Improvements

- **Recovery now uses actual client failure reasons**: `RecoveryCoordinator` now queries client state machines for actual failure reasons instead of using `FailureReason.UNKNOWN` for all degraded interfaces
- **XML-RPC server binding failure now includes failure reason**: OSError during XML-RPC server startup now passes `FailureReason.INTERNAL`

# Version 2025.12.36 (2025-12-19)

  - New `degraded_interfaces` field on `SystemStatusChangedEvent` for integration consumption
  - Updated `transition_to()` method with `degraded_interfaces` parameter
  - Log output now shows interface-specific failure reasons: `[interfaces: HmIP-RF=network, BidCos-RF=auth]`
  - **Integration benefit**: Home Assistant can now show detailed status per interface in DEGRADED state
  - See `docs/migrations/failure_reason_migration_2025_12.md` for usage examples

### Improvements

- **Recovery max-retries now propagates failure info**: When recovery fails after max retries, the FAILED transition now includes `failure_reason` and `failure_interface_id`

# Version 2025.12.35 (2025-12-19)

## What's Changed

### Improvements

  - Co-Authored-By: @Baxxy13

# Version 2025.12.32 (2025-12-16)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- **Refactor Simple Schedule Format**: Complete overhaul of simple schedule data structures used by climate thermostats
  - Old format: Tuple-based `(base_temperature, [periods])` with `ScheduleSlotType` enum keys
  - New format: TypedDict-based with lowercase string keys (e.g., `"starttime"`, `"endtime"`, `"temperature"`)
  - Replaces:
    - `CLIMATE_SIMPLE_WEEKDAY_DATA` → `SimpleWeekdaySchedule` TypedDict
    - `CLIMATE_SIMPLE_PROFILE_DICT` → `SimpleProfileSchedule` type alias
    - `CLIMATE_SIMPLE_SCHEDULE_DICT` → `SimpleScheduleDict` type alias
  - New TypedDict class: `SimpleSchedulePeriod` for individual schedule periods
  - Benefits:
    - ✅ Full JSON serialization support (enables Home Assistant custom cards)
    - ✅ Better type safety with TypedDict
    - ✅ Cleaner, more intuitive API with string keys
    - ✅ Reduced memory overhead (no enum objects)
  - **Migration required**: See `docs/migrations/simple_schedule_migration_2025_12.md` for step-by-step guide
  - Updated method signatures:
    - `ClimateWeekProfile.get_schedule_simple_weekday()` returns `SimpleWeekdaySchedule`
    - `ClimateWeekProfile.set_simple_weekday()` accepts `SimpleWeekdaySchedule`
    - `ClimateWeekProfile.get_schedule_simple_profile()` returns `SimpleProfileSchedule`
    - `CustomDpClimate.set_simple_schedule_weekday()` accepts `SimpleWeekdaySchedule`

### Improvements

  - New TypedDict class with `endtime: str` and `temperature: float` fields
  - Provides IDE autocomplete and better type checking for schedule slot access

- **Rename schedule type aliases**: Consistent naming with Simple Schedule types
  - `CLIMATE_WEEKDAY_DICT` → `ClimateWeekdaySchedule` (now `dict[int, ScheduleSlot]`)
  - `CLIMATE_PROFILE_DICT` → `ClimateProfileSchedule`
  - `CLIMATE_SCHEDULE_DICT` → `ClimateScheduleDict`
  - **Breaking change**: Downstream code using these type aliases must update imports

### Documentation

  - Includes before/after code examples
  - Search-and-replace patterns for automated migration
  - JSON serialization examples
  - Detailed API change documentation

# Version 2025.12.31 (2025-12-16)

## What's Changed

### Improvements (aiohomematic_test_support)

- **Fix patch cleanup in test factories**: Patches created in `FactoryWithClient.get_default_central()` are now explicitly stored and stopped during cleanup instead of relying on `patch.stopall()`. Ensures proper resource cleanup and prevents patch state leakage between tests.
- **Improve exception handling in mock creation**: Replace bare `except Exception: pass` with specific exception handling and debug logging in `get_mock()`. Now logs `AttributeError` and `TypeError` when methods cannot be copied to mock instances, improving debuggability.
- **Add cleanup methods to SessionPlayer**: New class methods for session data management:
  - `clear_all()` - Clear all cached session data
  - `clear_file(file_id)` - Clear data for specific file ID
  - `get_loaded_file_ids()` - List currently loaded file IDs
  - `get_memory_usage()` - Return approximate memory usage of cached data
- **Extract ADDRESS_DEVICE_TRANSLATION to JSON**: Device address-to-filename mappings (362 entries) now loaded from `data/device_translation.json` instead of hardcoded dict. Reduces maintenance burden and allows easy updates without code changes. Fallback to hardcoded dict maintained for backwards compatibility.

### Documentation (aiohomematic_test_support)

- Create detailed improvement analysis: `docs/test_support_improvements.md` - Comprehensive review of test support package identifying 10 issues and optimization opportunities with priority matrix
- Create executable implementation plan: `docs/test_support_implementation_plan.md` - Step-by-step guide with exact file paths and code blocks for implementing high-priority fixes

# Version 2025.12.30 (2025-12-16)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- Rename Protocol classes to follow `-Protocol` suffix convention:
  - `StateChangeCallback` → `StateChangeCallbackProtocol`
  - `HealthRecordCallback` → `HealthRecordCallbackProtocol`
  - `SyncEventHandler` → `SyncEventHandlerProtocol`
  - `AsyncEventHandler` → `AsyncEventHandlerProtocol`
- Refactor `is_valid` property on data points:
  - `is_valid` now combines temporal and status validity (`is_refreshed and is_status_valid`)
  - Previous `is_valid` behavior (temporal check only) moved to new `is_refreshed` property
  - Consumers relying on `is_valid` for temporal-only check should migrate to `is_refreshed`

### New Features

- Add STATUS parameter support for data points:
  - New `ParameterStatus` enum with values: `NORMAL`, `UNKNOWN`, `OVERFLOW`, `UNDERFLOW`, `ERROR`, `INVALID`, `UNUSED`
  - New `DataPointStatusReceivedEvent` for STATUS parameter events
  - `BaseParameterDataPoint` now automatically detects paired `*_STATUS` parameters (e.g., `LEVEL_STATUS` for `LEVEL`)
  - New properties on data points: `status`, `status_dpk`, `status_parameter`, `has_status_parameter`
  - New `is_refreshed` property: Returns if data point has received a value
  - New `is_status_valid` property: Returns if STATUS is NORMAL or no STATUS parameter exists
  - Updated `is_valid` property: Combined check (`is_refreshed and is_status_valid`)
  - STATUS events are automatically routed to the main parameter's data point
  - Callbacks are only triggered when status actually changes (not on refresh)
  - Add `has_parameter()` method to `ParamsetDescriptionProviderProtocol` and `ParamsetDescriptionCache`

### Bug Fixes

- Fix typo in enum name: `CalulatedParameter` → `CalculatedParameter`

### Improvements

- Document intentional camelCase exceptions for RPC callbacks in CLAUDE.md
- Improve type safety by replacing `*args` and `**kwargs` with TypedDict:
  - Create `StateChangeArgs` TypedDict with all entity-specific parameters (on/off, brightness, position, climate-specific, cover-specific)
  - Create `SystemEventArgs` TypedDict for flexible system event argument handling
  - Replace `**kwargs: Any` with `**kwargs: Unpack[StateChangeArgs]` in all `is_state_change()` methods across custom data point classes
  - Remove `**kwargs` from `publish_data_point_updated_event()` - now accepts no arguments for cleaner event handling
  - Replace climate callback `**kwargs: Any` with explicit `custom_id: str | None = None` parameter

# Version 2025.12.29 (2025-12-15)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix event publication

# Version 2025.12.28 (2025-12-14)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix central incorrectly transitioning to RUNNING during startup with empty client list: `all()` returns True for empty iterables, causing premature RUNNING state before clients are registered
- Fix central incorrectly transitioning to DEGRADED when all clients are connected: Missing `not all_connected` check in `start()` method allowed transition to DEGRADED even when all clients were CONNECTED
- Fix scheduler not starting when central is in DEGRADED state: Now starts when central is operational (RUNNING or DEGRADED)
- Fix HealthTracker not tracking clients: Clients were never registered with the health tracker after creation, causing `update_client_health()` to be a no-op. Now clients are properly registered during `start()` and unregistered during `stop()`

### Improvements

- Enhance state transition logging:

  - DEGRADED state now shows which clients are not connected (e.g., "clients not connected: Otto-Dev-929-BidCos-RF")
  - Client state machine now includes reason in log messages (e.g., "proxy initialized", "connection check failed")
  - Important client transitions (CONNECTED, DISCONNECTED, FAILED) now log at INFO level
  - Scheduler waiting message now shows current state

- Automatic health data updates:
  - Events received from backend now automatically update `last_event_received` in health tracker
  - RPC request success/failure automatically tracked via circuit breaker callbacks
  - Health tracker now provides accurate `can_receive_events`, `consecutive_failures`, `last_successful_request`, `last_failed_request` metrics

# Version 2025.12.27 (2025-12-14)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix firmware data not updating after refresh: Device descriptions cache was not being updated for existing devices during `refresh_firmware_data()` calls (both ad-hoc service calls and periodic checks). The cache update was skipped because the code incorrectly returned early when no "new" devices were found, even though existing device descriptions needed updating.

# Version 2025.12.26 (2025-12-14)

- Add `DeviceTriggerEvent` - event for device triggers (button press, sensor trigger)
  - `interface_id: str` - interface identifier
  - `channel_address: str` - device address (not channel address)
  - `parameter: str` - parameter name (e.g., PRESS_SHORT)
  - `value: str | int | float | bool` - event value
- Add `IntegrationIssue` dataclass for user-facing issues with severity, issue_id, translation_key

- Separate `FirmwareDataRefresher` protocol from `DeviceDataRefresher` protocol for clearer separation of concerns
- Implement `FirmwareDataRefresher` in `DeviceCoordinator` instead of `CentralUnit`
- Direct coordinator access pattern improves code clarity and reduces unnecessary delegation
- Unified protocol property naming - all protocols now use `state` instead of mixed `central_state`/`state`

- Replace fixed cool-down with staged reconnection for faster recovery after CCU restart:
  - Stage 0: Initial cool-down (`reconnect_initial_cooldown`, default 10s)
  - Stage 1: Non-invasive TCP port check (no CCU load, bypasses firewall ICMP blocks)
  - Stage 2: First `system.listMethods` check (verify RPC is responding)
  - Stage 3: Warmup delay (`reconnect_warmup_delay`, default 10s)
  - Stage 4: Second `system.listMethods` check (confirm services stable)
  - Stage 5: Full reconnection with proxy recreation
- New `TimeoutConfig` options:
  - `reconnect_initial_cooldown`: Initial wait before checks (default 10s)
  - `reconnect_tcp_check_timeout`: Max time for TCP checks (default 60s)
  - `reconnect_tcp_check_interval`: TCP check interval (default 5s)
  - `reconnect_warmup_delay`: Warmup delay after first RPC check (default 10s)

# Version 2025.12.24 (2025-12-12)

## What's Changed

### Bug Fixes

- Fix "ResponseNotReady" errors after CCU reconnection by recreating proxy objects with fresh HTTP transport after successful PROXY_INIT
- Add configurable cool-down period (`reconnect_cooldown_delay`, default 60s) after connection loss - all communication including pings is suspended during cool-down to allow CCU time to fully restart

# Version 2025.12.23 (2025-12-12)

## What's Changed

### Breaking Changes

- New Central State Machine architecture for improved reconnection reliability
  - Introduces `CentralState` enum with states: STARTING, INITIALIZING, RUNNING, DEGRADED, RECOVERING, FAILED, STOPPED
  - Central is RUNNING only when ALL clients are CONNECTED
  - DEGRADED state when at least one client is not connected
  - FAILED state after max retries (8 attempts) with heartbeat retry every 60 seconds
  - New protocol interfaces: `CentralStateMachineProtocol`, `CentralHealthProtocol`, `HealthTrackerProtocol`

### New Features

- Add `CentralStateMachine` class for orchestrating overall system state (`central/state_machine.py`)
- Add `ConnectionHealth` and `CentralHealth` classes for unified health tracking (`central/health.py`)
- Add `RecoveryCoordinator` for coordinated client recovery with max retry tracking (`central/recovery.py`)
- Add `CentralStateChangedEvent` to EventBus for monitoring state transitions
- Add `ClientStateChangedEvent` to EventBus for monitoring client state changes
- Add `state` property to `ClientConnectionProtocol` protocol for accessing current client state
- Add health score calculation (0.0-1.0) based on state machine, circuit breakers, and activity
- Add exponential backoff for recovery retries (5s base, up to 60s max)
- Add multi-stage data load verification in recovery process
- New test suite for central state machine architecture (33 tests)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix entities not marked unavailable after failed proxy initialization - devices now correctly show unavailable during CCU restart/recovery

# Version 2025.12.22 (2025-12-12)

## What's Changed

### Enhancements

- Improve CCU reconnection behavior with exponential backoff (2s initial, doubles up to 120s max)
- Add configurable `TimeoutConfig` in `CentralConfig` for connection/reconnect timing settings

### Bug Fixes

- Fix data loading after partial reconnect - load data for available interfaces immediately instead of waiting for all
- Fix premature data loading - verify both state machine and actual connection before loading; retry up to 8 times with circuit breaker reset between attempts
- Fix client reconnect logic - use state machine check to prevent skipping reconnect when connection is lost
- Fix state machine allowing recovery from `FAILED` state via reconnect attempts
- Fix JSON-RPC session renewal after CCU restart - `AuthFailure` now triggers fresh login
- Fix race condition in scheduler client iteration with snapshot

# Version 2025.12.21 (2025-12-11)

## What's Changed

### Enhancements

- Circuit breakers automatically reset after successful reconnect to allow immediate data refresh
- Add `reset_circuit_breakers()` method to `ClientConnectionProtocol` protocol

### Bug Fixes

- Fix entities remaining unavailable after CCU reconnect - circuit breakers now reset automatically, allowing immediate data refresh instead of waiting for slow recovery

# Version 2025.12.20 (2025-12-11)

## What's Changed

### Enhancements

- Add BackupData dataclass with filename and content for backup downloads
- Backup filename now includes hostname and CCU version (e.g., `Otto-3.83.6.20251025-2025-12-10-1937.sbk`)
- `create_backup_and_download()` now returns `BackupData | None` instead of `bytes | None`
- Add firmware update support for OpenCCU via `checkFirmwareUpdate.sh`
- Add `HmUpdate` hub entity for system firmware updates (OpenCCU only)
- Add `get_system_update_info()` method to check for available firmware updates
- Add `trigger_firmware_update()` method to initiate firmware update with automatic reboot (runs with nohup)
- Add `SystemUpdateData` dataclass with `check_script_available` field to verify script availability
- Add progress tracking for hub firmware updates:
  - New `in_progress` property on `HmUpdate` to track update status
  - Automatic polling every 30 seconds during update to detect completion
  - Progress detection via firmware version change
  - 30-minute timeout with graceful cleanup
  - Events published on progress state changes for Home Assistant integration

### Architecture

- Migrate `CentralConnectionState` callbacks to unified EventBus pattern:
  - Add `ConnectionStateChangedEvent` for connection state changes (connected/disconnected)
  - Add `EventBus.publish_sync()` method for synchronous event publishing from non-async code
  - Rename `StateChangeCallback` to `StateChangeCallbackProtocol` and remove `register_state_change_callback()` method
  - Add `event_bus` property to `ClientDependencies` protocol
  - All connection state notifications now use the same EventBus as other events
- EventBus now uses TaskScheduler (Looper) for proper task lifecycle management:
  - `publish_sync()` uses TaskScheduler when available for task tracking, shutdown handling, and exception logging
  - Falls back to raw asyncio when no TaskScheduler is provided (e.g., in tests)

### Developer Tools

- Enhance `check_i18n_catalogs.py` to detect unused translation keys:
  - Add detection of translation keys in `strings.json` that are not used in the codebase
  - Add `--remove-unused` flag to automatically remove unused keys from all catalog files
  - Unused keys are reported as warnings (non-blocking) to avoid disrupting commits
  - Current statistics: 185 total keys, 181 used (97.8%), 4 unused (2.2%)
- Add comprehensive i18n management documentation at `docs/i18n_management.md`

### Bug Fixes

- Fix excessive ERROR logging during CCU restart/reconnect - connection errors now log ERROR only on first occurrence, DEBUG for subsequent failures (fixes inverted logic in `CentralConnectionState.add_issue()` usage)
- Fix PING_PONG false alarm mismatch events during CCU restart - PINGs sent during downtime are no longer tracked when connection is known to be down, and cache is cleared on reconnect
- Scheduler now pauses non-essential jobs during connection issues - only `_check_connection` continues to run during CCU downtime, preventing unnecessary RPC calls and log spam
- Reduce INFO-level log noise during reconnection - circuit breaker successful recovery transitions (half_open → closed) now log at DEBUG level instead of INFO

### Notes

- Firmware update features are only available on OpenCCU systems where `/bin/checkFirmwareUpdate.sh` is present
- Backup before firmware update should be done via `create_backup_and_download()` in Home Assistant before triggering the update

# Version 2025.12.19 (2025-12-10)

## What's Changed

### Architecture

    LinkOperationsProtocol, FirmwareOperationsProtocol, SystemVariableOperationsProtocol, ProgramOperationsProtocol,
    BackupOperationsProtocol, MetadataOperationsProtocol
  - **Support Protocol (1):** ClientSupportProtocol (utility methods and caches)
  - Handler classes explicitly inherit their sub-protocols for compile-time type checking
- Add CentralProtocol composite protocol combining 29 sub-protocols:
  - CentralUnit now inherits from CentralProtocol (+ PayloadMixin, LogContextMixin)
  - Provides single protocol for complete central unit access
  - Maintains ability to depend on specific sub-protocols for better decoupling
- Add CircuitBreaker integration to JSON-RPC client (AioJsonRpcAioHttpClient):
  - Prevents retry-storms during backend outages for JSON-RPC calls
  - Consistent resilience pattern across both XML-RPC and JSON-RPC clients
  - Session management methods (login/logout/renew) bypass circuit breaker
- Add RequestCoalescer for get_device_description in DeviceOperationsHandler:

# Version 2023.2.5 (2023-02-05)

## What's Changed

- Fix GitHub build/publish
- Add comments to parameter_visibility
- Use `put_paramset` only when there is more than one parameter to sent
- Use only one implementation for garage doors (HO/TM)
- Avoid backend calls if value/state doesn't change
  - If an entity (e.g. `switch`) has only **one** parameter that represents its state, then a call to the backend will be made,
    if the parameter value sent is not identical to the current state.
  - If an entity (e.g. `cover`, `climate`, `light`) has **multiple** parameters that represent its state, then a call to the backend will be made,
    if one of these parameter values sent is not identical to its current state.
  - Not covered by this approach:
    - platforms: lock and siren.
    - services: `stop_cover`, `stop_cover_tilt`, `enable_away_mode_*`, `disable_away_mode`, `set_on_time_value`
    - system variables
- Add virtual channels for HmIP cover/blind:
  - Channel no as examples from HmIP-BROLL. The implementation of the first actor channel (4) remains unchanged, which means that this channel (4) shows the correct cover position from sensor channel (3).
    The other actor channels (5+6) are generated as initially deactivated and only use the cover position from their own channel after activation.
